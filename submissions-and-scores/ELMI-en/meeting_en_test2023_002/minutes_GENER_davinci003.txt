(PERSON2) Yeah, I think that it's it's it's really hard to to to finish it in time.
But I think that it's possible.


- Person 1 and Person 2 discussed the progress of the Czech ASR and the paper Person 2 wants to write for EMNLP.
- Person 1 offered to help Person 2 with the Flask part of the project after June 10th.
- Person 2 explained that they need an HTTP server that can receive a stream of audio and send back a stream of text for multiple users at the same time.
- Person 2 suggested using Flask, but Person 1 suggested using Hypercore instead.
- Person 2 suggested having two connections for the server, one for streaming audio and one for getting audio back.
- Person 1 and Person 2 discussed their exams, with Person 1 having two exams and Person 2 having four or five assignments.
- Person 1 and Person 2 discussed the difficulty of their courses, with Person 1's course allowing Python and Person 2's course requiring C++.



- They discussed the difficulty of exams and how they are easier to read for.
- They discussed the difficulty of the course [PERSON5] was taking and how it was not graded.
- They discussed the difficulty of low latency translation and how it can lead to lower quality translations.
- They discussed the use of (BLEU) and (COMET) metrics for translation quality.
- They discussed the possibility of using a data set with human evaluation for compression.
- They discussed the possibility of shortening translations for faster reading.
- They discussed the possibility of isometric translation to match the length of the source.
- They discussed the use of isometric translation for comedy shows with fast dialogue.
- [PERSON7] is done with IWSLT and is in Paris for an internship.

- Meeting discussed the potential of text compression and machine translation compression
- Discussed the potential of shortening sentences while preserving the information
- Discussed the differences in language pace and how it affects the length of sentences
- Discussed the potential of using different grammar in different languages to save words
- Discussed the challenges of dubbing movies in different languages to match the original pace
- Discussed the potential of removing unnecessary information in complex sentences
- Discussed the potential of using special words in some languages to describe something that would need a description sentence in other languages


- Online speech translation should have low latency and high quality
- Shortening of speech is not recommended
- Translation should commit to something and correct itself if the guess is bad
- Compound words and context can affect the translation
- Retranslating systems are not recommended


- Retranslating systems are a standalone thing and not necessarily the state of the art
- Retranslating systems are an artificial construct created by developers
- Retranslating systems are not necessarily useful or stable
- Retranslating systems are not necessary for live speech to text translation
- Retranslating systems should not be used to flicker between unstable hypotheses
- The model should correct itself in a way a human translator would if they had the time to think about the mistake
- The model should produce a general translation with reduced context and then specify it with more context
- The model should not cut off the sentence in the middle of a word and restart the sentence
- The model should finish the sentence and then try to recover from the mistake
- Goal is to have a one-time translation that cannot be undone
- System should do lengthening, not necessarily shortening
- Monotonization of sentences should be used
- Output should be as fluent as possible
- Low latency should be a priority
- Reference should not be monotonous
- Reordering network should be used
- Authors handpicked examples looked good
- Brainstorming session was successful
- Retranslating system should not be focused on
