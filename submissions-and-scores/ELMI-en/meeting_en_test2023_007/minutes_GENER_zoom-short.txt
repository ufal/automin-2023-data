PERSON11 and PERSON13 discuss the upcoming events and the evaluation process for the ladder climbing and regular reports.
They discuss the need for complementary metrics for the ASR and PROJEC210 domains, such as profanity filtering, rare words evaluation, and status per language pair.
PERSON11 suggests using a multi-source tool to ship audio to multiple ASR or multiple workers and a language checker to merge the outputs.
PERSON2 suggests asking PERSON3 to extract positive plus negative lists from domain documents and delay scores from the PROJECT3 test set.
PERSON2 has done a lot of work for the end of the year and is happy with the tables that they have put into the tables.
PERSON12 suggests having a call with PERSON8 and PERSON5 to compare the performance of the models using PROJECT1.
PERSON9 is included in the call as a replacement for PERSON8.
