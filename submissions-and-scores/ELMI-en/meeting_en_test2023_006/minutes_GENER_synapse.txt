SUMMARY
- PERSON19 is starting to run the experiments that PERSON11 told him about.

- PERSON11 is waiting for the input from ORGANIZATION3.
- He promised PERSON17, PERSON19 and PERSON11 will have a separate call tomorrow afternoon at 2 PM or 3 PM.
- They will talk about the multi-source research.
- PERSON17 will send a link to the ORGANIZATION4 calendar.

- The integration will probably take place on the Tuesday PERSON17 has started to prepare a do-it-yourself integration for the profanity filtering.

- PERSON15's rainbow worker was better in speed, but was not better in scores.
- The multi-lingual model was trained using tensor to tensor, which makes it slow.
- PERSON6, PERSON17 and PERSON8 are having technical issues with PROJECT2.
- As a fallback solution, they should have the PRO PROJECT2 models running as a worker on their side.
- PERSON6 is working on shortening and extending rainbow models.
- He is trying to vary the amount and length of data and to create synthetic data from PROJECT7 dataset.
- PERSON6 has 50 gigabytes of data on Troja.
- ORGANIZATION97 takes a lot of space, organization97's one hundred language models take a lot, they take like fifty gigabytes themselves.
- ORGANIZATION2 has space, they give it away only after people have thought about it.
