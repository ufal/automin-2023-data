- Person2 arrived late to the project meeting
- Person2 discussed the status of the deliverables and the upcoming sessions
- Person12 reported that the report on multilingual machine translations was almost complete and waiting for input from Person14
- Person15 reported that the report on integration was done for the per voice site and they were waiting for Person17 to provide the numbers
- Person8 reported that their part was not yet complete but they would do it today
- Person2 asked Person9 about the status of D1.5 and Person9 reported that it was ready for review
- Person2 asked Person18 about the status of the training and Person18 reported that they had English and German to German, English, French, Italian, Spanish and Li said they should have 5-5 by the end of the year
- Person2 asked if the model was deployed and Person18 confirmed that it was integrated with the mediator
- Person2 asked Person15 if there was any possible optimization so that [Organization3] did not have to deploy 10 workers and Person15 reported that it was planned but not done yet

So, [PERSON1], please, eh, please, eh, contact them and see what they need.
And then, eh, we will have to, eh, to prepare for that.
So, yeah, that's it.


- Discussing milestone number twelve, which is called Improved ASR systems
- [ORGANIZATION3] will deploy two to five system as a pair of workers, one from English to five and one from German to four
- Evaluate the workers with the updated text client
- Trade fair of student companies in March as a possible source of non-native English speech
- [ORGANIZATION5] part 1 in mid-April, online, with unknown technical means
- [PROJECT5] 2021 towards the end of the year, with non-native English to target languages
- Smaller event on January 25th with Center for Visual History of Malach, domain adaptation possible



- Discuss management of project events, including Monday seminars, test sessions, [PROJECT5], and [ORGANIZATION5] congress
- Recordings of important sessions are necessary for evaluation and analysis
- Nominate someone responsible for making recordings of important sessions
- Test platform and recording device for each online event
- Mid-January call with [PERSON5], [PERSON2], [PERSON4], [PERSON18], [PERSON10], and [PERSON15] to discuss status of project
- Discuss making project more robust and scalable
- Discuss running models in the cloud and cost implications
- Project meeting discussed the need for significant effort to input data into PROJECT3
- It was discussed that for single sentence translation, comparable speeds can be achieved on CPU and GPU
- The easiest route would be to have servers hardware on premises within the consortium that can run dockerized packages and use own GPU
- The complexity lies in the pipeline which involves source languages, target languages, and set up of what has been done by both models
- Regularly testing the given pipeline and running it on existing instances of mediator and workers is important
- As a fallback solution, dockerized systems can be deployed on paid servers
- Research angle discussed was simultaneous SLT and how it could be made better
- Europe- [ORGANIZATION1] speech interpretation corpus, Esic, compiled by [PERSON12] will be suitable for this
- [PERSON12]'s corpus has audio of the original speaker and the interpreter, as well as text translation of the English transcript
- Collaboration between [PERSON12] and [PERSON18] is needed to squash the data and do the experiment with data augmentation
- Experiment with different improvements of MT for the purposes of online translation should be done
- Agree to have a weekly call between [PERSON18] and [PERSON12] on the abridging topic and another support call with [PERSON4] for online translation
- Consider merging the two calls into one
- Create a subteam within the project to run experiments and write papers
- [PERSON2] will set up a Doodle poll to find a regular slot in the week for the calls
- Cross-partner team will include at least [PERSON4], [PERSON18], [PERSON12], and [PERSON2]
- [PERSON12] will compile first beta version of the corpus and pass it to [PERSON16]
- [PERSON18] has answers from [PERSON11] and [PERSON6] with a complete five to five pipeline, including ASR, for German, English, French, Spanish, and Italian
- [PERSON18] also has a strong MT model for English to Portuguese, Dutch, Croatian, Slovenian, Polish, and Turkish
- [PERSON2] will update [PERSON16] on the call updates
