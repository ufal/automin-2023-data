But you have to give them enough time to prepare the system.
And if the system is not ready, then the paper is not ready.
So I think it's better to have a later timing.


- Project meeting discussed the TD ID of keyword extraction and summarization for meeting data
- Commonly occurring words such as "hello" and "mhm" are extracted, resulting in poor summarization
- Discussed the possibility of SIGDial or Interspeech for the shared task
- SIGDial is earlier than Interspeech, but may attract more participants
- SIGDial timeline is not yet published, but may follow the same timeline as previous years
- Interspeech has a later timeline, but requires more preparation
- It is preferable to have at least four months buffer time for the shared task

(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON7) And package B is four hundred eighty euros for one year.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON7) So -
(PERSON3) So let's let's try the student one.
(PERSON7) Yes.


- Project meeting discussed the timeline for a shared task project
- Need to have three months of sitting, just or like having it on their to do lists
- In two weeks, they will do it
- Participants may come up with problems that need to be fixed and re-published
- WMT is a rare example of test sets and training data being updated
- SIGDial 2021 is in June, with paper submission deadline in March
- Interspeech has a special track set up, but doesn't fit the project's needs
- Need to apply for [ORGANIZATION7] membership, either student or institutional
- Student membership is 20 euros, institutional is 240 euros
- Need to submit proposal soon for Interspeech, with PBML as backup plan
- Authors can choose to submit to Interspeech or PBML, with PBML as the preferred option

(PERSON6) So we don't have anything like that.
So we need to create something like that.
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So that's that's the thing that we need to do.


- Estimate for Interspeech registration is 4 researchers and 2 students
- Ask [PERSON1] at [ORGANIZATION5] what type of membership is preferred for the department
- Email [PERSON5] at [ORGANIZATION5] for website setup
- Browse for existing projects at [ORGANIZATION5], [ORGANIZATION4], and [ORGANIZATION8]
- [PERSON6] to run [PERSON8]'s code on meeting data to check if results are decent
- [PERSON7] to share evaluation metrics on dry run minuting data
- Create gold standard for automatic metrics
- [PERSON10] to have access to transcribed data for anonymization

(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON4) So, yeah.
(PERSON3) So, yeah, so, okay, so, I think, we are done.
So, yeah, so, please, make a timeline and share it with [PERSON10].
And then, yeah, we can continue.


- Prepare an automatic metric without gold reference
- Split the data into training, development, and final test parts
- Choose one or two gold standard metrics
- Implement summarization methods
- Contact authors of recent [ORGANIZATION3] paper to validate implementation and invite them to shared task
- Make a timeline for data preparation and share it with [PERSON10]
- Anonymize data with help of annotators
- Alignments are useful for evaluation but not for anonymization
- Need to anonymise and publish data in time
- Do not release any alignments
- Data will be used for evaluation
- Host to discuss with [PERSON7] and [PERSON10]
- Meeting concluded with goodbyes
