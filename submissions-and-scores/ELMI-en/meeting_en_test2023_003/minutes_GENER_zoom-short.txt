PERSON1 and PERSON4 are discussing the annotation of a document with PERSON5 and PERSON7.
They discuss the timeline for the data deidentification and the need for full samples for the task.
They decide to leave the mock entities in English and Czech, but leave the names of the entities in the mock languages.
They also discuss the need to connect the basic operator to the lexical grafers in the seminars, and PERSON4 mentions that he will try to connect it to PERSON7's.
Finally, they discuss how to ensure no N I leaks into the final data and the open problems of the edition of new documents.
PERSON1 suggests that they submit the proposal within PERSON4uary 7th or 8th and contact the people who have declined or accepted the invitation.
