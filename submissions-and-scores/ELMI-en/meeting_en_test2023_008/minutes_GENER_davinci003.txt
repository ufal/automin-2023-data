(PERSON6) Yeah, I'm, I'm going to use it for the evaluation.


- Person3 and Person4 discussed the ACL paper and the reproducibility checklist
- Person4 mentioned that the model works almost perfectly and that it learns to inflect the constraints properly
- Person3 suggested adversarial evaluation and attention analysis to further analyze the model
- Person6 suggested that the problem with the automatic evaluation is the lack of references with the correct word surface
- Person4 mentioned that the (European) dataset is quite easy because there is not much ambiguity
- Person3 suggested cross domain experiments to train on one domain and test with terminology from another domain
- Person6 mentioned that they are manually checking the Portugese language model and have around 200 sentences so far

So, ah, this is the document that [PERSON2] was referring to.


- Project meeting focused on training data for a project involving English-Portuguese translation
- Person6 suggested using editor auditing and coding domain in the training as training data
- Person3 asked if Person6 had received a response from Person7 yet
- Person1 suggested forwarding the email to Person7 and suggested looking for master thesis repositories
- Person3 suggested testing the system in a cross-domain scenario and avoiding retraining the model
- Person4 suggested using artificial examples and looking for math terminology for translation of math books into Czech
- Person1 suggested using the [PROJECT1] test set, which is organized according to indices, and suggested focusing on gender transformations
- Person2 suggested using the sub-lease agreement document as an example of terminology that needs to be translated in a distinct way
- Two parties in an agreement have their gender and the gender must be preserved
- Links will be pasted for auditing domain and possibly (CL) domain
- Little or no reference translations, so manually checked
- OST equals English source, TTCS star equals check reference or more
- Written audits in a directory
- Annotations for 90 lines of audit and 30 lines of <unintelligible/>
- Export markables or manually check what is the correct translation
- Sentences with correct label manually validated
- WMT [PROJECT1] test set for (Bles core) evaluation
- WMT 20 testsuite markables by [PERSON2] for specific terms evaluation
- [PERSON8] data for English Portuguese data
- Multi source data from [PERSON8] with no comments
- Word document conversion
- Call about data on Monday after meeting
