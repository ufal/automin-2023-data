- The European Parliament held a debate on visa fees for Belarus and Ukraine citizens
- Many speakers argued that the EU should facilitate access for citizens of neighbouring countries
- The EU has not yet entered into negotiations on an agreement on visa facilitation for Belarus due to the political situation
- Belarusian citizens can already travel within the EU under existing legislation
- For Ukraine, the situation is more positive, with the Agreement on visa fees stipulating that Schengen states will charge €35 for processing visa applications, rather than the average cost of €60
- Some categories of Ukrainian citizens could benefit from a full waiver of the visa fee
- The European Commission is working on ways to make visa procedures easier for citizens of the Western Balkan States, which could also be applied to countries like Ukraine.
