- In the case of Ukraine, the Agreement on readmission and the Agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas set the scene for closer people-to-people contacts and a closer partnership in all areas, while also
The Commission is now up-to-date with the most recent developments regarding the visa issue with Ukraine and Belarus. 

The current situation is that more than 50% of Ukrainian nationals now wishing to travel to Schengen countries benefit from a full waiving of the visa fee.

Furthermore, there are no plans to open discussions on the possible facilitation of the issuance of visas and on readmission with Belarus at this stage. However, the existing acquis on the issuance of short

The members of the European Parliament, represented by the EP President, gave a positive vote to the proposal to extend the measures against Belarus. The EP members expressed their concern over the situation of the democratic movement in Belarus, the human rights violations by the regime and its interaction with the Council of Europe and the OSCE and asked the Council and the Commission to conduct a more aggressive policy towards Belarus.
The member states were informed of the exemption of certain countries from the visa requirement for visits
- The European Union will not guarantee the security of its Eastern border by ignoring the interests of Belarusians and Ukrainians
- We should support visits to the Union by the widest possible groups of people specifically from Ukraine and Belarus, and at the same time isolating the Lukashenka regime

But charging EUR 60 - a third of a month's salary in Belarus - for a visa flies in the face of that policy..

I welcome today's debate and the information provided by the Commissioner. While I accept that this is a very demanding process, I also think that it is vital to find a solution. Visa issue involving Belarusian citizens were also examined during Belarus Week in the European Parliament. It is our duty to help the people who are the hapless victims of Lukashenko's regime. We have to adopt as quickly as possible a solution to simplify the visa regime. That will send a positive and

This applies to prices and to procedures..  The prices are prohibitive and the procedures humiliating..  These people queue for long hours, for dozens of hours..  Is this transitional or permanent?.

President: Thank you very much indeed for your comments, and I would like to make two observations. Firstly, I share your concern about the perception that the EU is a far-off institution that only talks, but not acts. I will certainly convey this message to my fellow Commissioners. Secondly, you highlighted that there are problems for Western Balkan citizens in completing lengthy procedures, and I too will take this up with my team. I hope you will continue to provide me with your feedback on the
