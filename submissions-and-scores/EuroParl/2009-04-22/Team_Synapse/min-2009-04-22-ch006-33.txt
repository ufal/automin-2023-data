SUMMARY
- There is an inconsistency between the exchange rates applicable for SMS caps and the cut-off limit and the text should be added at the end of Article 1(4) of the original regulation: 'The same reference exchange rates shall be applied to annually revise the value of the charges governed by Articles 4a, 4b and 6a(3) where these charges are denominated in currencies other than the euro.'
