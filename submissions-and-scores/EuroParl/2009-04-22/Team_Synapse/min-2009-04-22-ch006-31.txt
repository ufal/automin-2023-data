SUMMARY
- The Commission presented a strategy to reduce the general risk and adverse impact of pesticides on human health and the environment in July 2006.
- The last element of that strategy is the proposal for a directive on machinery for pesticide application amending Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery.
- The Directive sets out the requirements with which the machinery for application should comply in order to limit the adverse effects on the environment, the operator and the surroundings.
- Some of the amendments were not adopted and will be contained in standards developed by the European Committee for Standardization.
