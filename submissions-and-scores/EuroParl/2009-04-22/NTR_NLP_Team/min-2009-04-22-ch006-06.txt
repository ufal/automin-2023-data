Meeting KeyPoints:

Given the fact that negotiations for this directive started last year, 6 months before the end of the Czech presidency, with Parliament being the instigator, I can only applaud the work done by Jean Lambert and the whole team. 

But at the same time I would like to highlight a couple of points:
- The lack of transparency surrounding the process of social security coordination and of the related penalties was a strong concern for Parliament, and it is good to see that it was taken into consideration.
