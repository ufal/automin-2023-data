The EU and Turkmenistan are going to sign an interim trade agreement.  The EU will monitor the human rights situation in Turkmenistan closely and will take into account recommendations from the European Parliament when considering future measures to be taken against Turkmenistan.
I believe the best way to establish this philosophy is to start by postponing this new trade agreement that you are proposing to us, and thus not to give our assent, which we are being asked to give today.
