- Summarize the meeting:

1. The EU's accession to the Transport Protocol of the Alpine Convention is a small but important step in the development of a new transport policy in Europe.
2. The Protocol addresses concerns related to the efficiency, fluidity, safety, people living near, and environment surrounding the routes.
3. Austria is reassured that its 15-year membership of the EU has led to Europe taking on these concerns.
4. The speaker thanked all the Members who contributed to this.
