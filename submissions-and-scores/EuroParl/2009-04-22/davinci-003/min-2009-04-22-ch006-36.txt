• The Commission presented a strategy in July 2006 to reduce the general risk and adverse impact of pesticides on human health and the environment. 
• The last element of the strategy is a proposal for a directive on machinery for pesticide application, amending Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery. 
• The directive sets out the requirements with which the machinery for application should comply in order to limit the adverse effects of pesticides on the environment, the operator and the surroundings. 
• The draft of the proposal and suggested amendments were the subject of discussion during workshops, at meetings with representatives of the Council, the Commission, shadow rapporteurs and interested parties, and during tri-partite talks. 
• Amendment 39 was adopted and this position has been confirmed by the Council. 
• The Commission welcomed compromise Amendment 39 and is looking forward to the rapid adoption of the proposal along those lines. 
• The Commission will mandate CEN to develop harmonised standards for each category of machinery for pesticide application, based on the best available techniques for preventing unintended exposure of the environment to pesticides.
