- The European Commission presented a strategy in July 2006 to reduce the risk and adverse impact of pesticides on human health and the environment.
- The last element of this strategy is a proposal for a directive on machinery for pesticide application, amending Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery.
- The directive sets out requirements for machinery to limit the adverse effects of pesticides on the environment, the operator, and the surroundings.
- Establishing these requirements will reduce differences between regulations and procedures in EU countries, ensure a uniform level of environmental protection, and enable free flow of these machines in the EU market.
- The Commission welcomes compromise Amendment 39 and looks forward to the rapid adoption of the proposal along those lines.
