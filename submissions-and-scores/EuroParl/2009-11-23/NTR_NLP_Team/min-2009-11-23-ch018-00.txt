Meeting KeyPoints:

Sure. I would like to thank James for the interesting timing and for briefing us on the contents of the reports.

- Rules on the confidentiality of the information exchanged by Europol with third States or between Europol and third States.
- List of third States and third States or sub-
Following President Klaus's signature and therefore the Treaty of Lisbon becoming a reality, the negotiations with the Council and Commission have become obsolete. 

This report, along with his colleagues' reports, calls for a rejection of the Council text. He would like to make it clear that he supports the aim of the Council Decision, as we are in favour of better exchange of information, and recognise the benefits Europol brings to Member States regarding law enforcement and crime fighting. We would like to keep Europol
Following a brief exchange of views between the representatives of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the latter being represented by Ms. Valentina Lukashova, Deputy Director-General for Justice, Freedom and Security, Sophia in 't Veld, rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, announced that:
1. The European Parliament supports the aims of the Council's framework decision;
2. The legal clarity regarding LIBE reports is
- That the current legal basis for Europol is outdated and should be re-examined.
- That Parliament must be part of the decision-making process around Europol, including the ability to change the legal basis for it.
- That the American government would have full access to Europol's database of personal data. 
 - That the lack of international agreement on standards for such data handling produces a gap in government powers
-- Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra called for the Council's proposal to be withdrawn because he wants a Parliament that is much more visible and the Treaty of Lisbon to be followed regarding the decisions on the Europol package
-- One of the main tasks entrusted to the European Police Office is to collect, store, process, analyze and exchange information and data in order to carry out this important task, the competent authorities in the Member States need to send comprehensive, up-
- The work files are the only legal tool at European level for storing, processing and analysing information, whether it be information from the field or intelligence, including personal data.
- Proposal to create a legal instrument that guarantees full respect of fundamental rights of European citizens.
- The need to collect and process information means that a legal instrument must be created that guarantees full respect of fundamental rights of European citizens.  In this respect,
- The European network on crime prevention has seen its work structure collapse, leading to the virtual elimination of the civil society from the network
- The network was created in 2005 with the purpose of tackling crime prevention at European level through concrete action at the national level
- Despite this, the network now wants to establish an external secretariat funded with funds from EU programmes
- The proposal envisages the network to be composed of a secretariat, of contact points designated by each member state and of a board
The the three reports have different objectives. The report on Europol proposes to introduce the new Agency on the terms provided by the new Treaty. The report on forensics would adapt the already existing intergovernmental convention to the new needs. The report on video surveillance would strengthen the powers of the Surveillance Authority in the UK.
The European Commission is in favour of using accreditation of laboratories specialised in DNA and fingerprint analyses, because it would increase the public's confidence in the reliability of the results and, more generally, in the added value of these analyses. Indeed, stricter accreditation of these laboratories would lead to increased public confidence and trust. In this regard, the European Commission is aware of the problems relating to the legal basis. In line with Parliament's opinion, the European Commission declares that it reserves the right to
- Organised crime and crime in general are increasingly crossing borders
- Large-scale cross-border crime is often the big issue when we talk about citizens' Europe
- On that score, the Group of the European People's Party is strongly in favour of not just Europol but also Eurodac being put in a strong position
- I would like us to pay more attention to the victim's position during combating crime
- Fundamental
Ramón Jáuregui Atondo wants the new Commissioner to tell the next one that the legislative package on these matters will be drafted. The whole House is asking the Commission to do it and it will not be possible before the end of the legislative term.
- Raül Romeva i Rueda stated that given the chance to carry out the legislative work with the European Parliament, they would need to wait and see how this developed
- On the need for coordination on forensic laboratories, Raül Romeva i Rueda stated that they must also examine the matter of decentralisation very carefully
- Raül Romeva i Rueda stated that before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament had been asked to examine four texts
The Council should withdraw the proposal for a regulation on a European Union Police Office. Extracting confidential information of EU citizens should be conducted within a strict legal framework that ensures the confidentiality of the information and provides for a balance between the need to obtain the information and the security aims. Moreover, the citizens of the EU should have the possibility to prevent the unnecessary and excessive use of coercive measures in the fight against crime.

- It was confirmed that the EU does not have the need for a single police force
- It was also suggested that Europol officers have immunity from prosecution for anything they do or say whilst on duty
- It was confirmed that the EU does not need a separate judiciary as it had already created a system of its own through the European arrest warrant and trials in absentia
- It was suggested that the
Simon Busuttil: Mr President, allow me first to express my congratulations and thanks to the Vice-President of the Commission for everything he has done as the Commissioner responsible for this area. I hope that the two Commissioners who succeed you - not one Commissioner but two - will draw inspiration from your political vision, your commitment and your work. Thank you, Mr Vice-President.  Let me now come to the point concerning the excellent opportunity I recently had to visit the office in my country
1. Parliament rejects the proposal due to a lack of adequate guarantees that the fundamental rights of EU citizens would be adequately respected. 
2. Parliament welcomes the ambitious objectives of the European Police Union but rejects the proposal's insufficient guarantees for the protection of personal data.
3. Parliament welcomes the fact that the new EU agency Europol will be legally founded and welcomes the exchange of data between member states.
* We need to implement the European values of security and freedom of individuals in negotiations with the United States, in order to safeguard European citizens
* We must demand from the Council and the Commission that this fundamental principle and these guidelines be implemented in negotiations with the United States
* We need to create a stronger legitimacy for the European Crime Prevention Network, in light of the fact that the network has not been as effective as it could have been
Sure, I’d like to briefly discuss the following three examples out of many that were presented in the meeting:
– The agreement on the “SWIFT” (Sensitive WIthdrawal and ATM Information) technical standards, which I think is questionable in multiple ways and, therefore, will be subjected to critical scrutiny by the European Parliament next Monday.
– The agreement on the High Representative’s role, which is a very important sign of the citizens’ commitment to implementing the Treaty of
- The Mafia has a beginning and an end
- Organised crime has to be fought more effectively
- There is a very close relationship between Mafia organisations and corruption
- Fraud in the European Union
- Europol is a very effective tool to fight crime
- The rejection of the proposals is not to stand in the way of Europol assuming its new role, but to have the powers of this Parliament extended
- The handling of
- I hope the Council will launch initiatives as soon as possible and produce a new document as soon as possible in which the European Parliament will also have considerable involvement.
- Despite the fact that I wanted to talk more about forensic laboratories, Mr President, I would like to say in conclusion that it is definitely not my ambition to inflate the importance of the European Parliament, but I consider it absolutely unprecedented that no representative of the Council
The Commission welcomes the broad political agreement on the revised proposal for a Regulation on a European Police Force (REPOL regulation) and the acceptance of Parliament's opinion on the involvement of the European Parliament in police and judicial cooperation matters.
The next step is the adoption of the proposal before the European Parliament and the Council by 25 March 2020, in accordance with the existing two-yearly rotation.
The Commission will carefully examine Parliament's opinion in order to propose amending the third pillar acquis in the
Thank you, Members, for the opportunity to present the state of play of the discussions on the new texts that will shape the new Members' mandate. I would like to express my gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr James Nicholson, and the rapporteur, Mr Gilles de Kerchove, for their active and constructive participation in these debates.
The latest discussions have rightly focused on the proper balance between the rights of the victims and those of the perpetrators of crime
The meeting ended with the European Council promising to withdraw or review the decision as quickly as possible and to fully involve the European Parliament in a full codecision procedure.
- The Council regrets the lack of democratic scrutiny of the decision to establish the European Police Office, which it believes contravenes the principles of democratic control in the European Union
- Tomorrow, the Parliament will call on the Council to put forward a new legislative package on crime prevention, forensics and Europol within six months in order to allow adequate democratic control of these policy areas
- In the meantime, the Council will not assist the Parliament in promoting the very policies it questions
Thanks to Sonia Alfano for the opportunity to share our concerns regarding the Council's treatment of the report on the European crime prevention network.  Specifically, we believe the Council is not showing sufficient leadership to establish a  powerful, integrated network of crime prevention agencies - a crime network - as part of the next step in the evolving European Union in response to the pressing needs of law enforcement and justice across the EU.  The network would complement and supplement national efforts to prevent and control crime
President: Please allow me also to join those who have congratulated Jacques Barrot for his responsible and excellent work..  I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work..  The joint debate is closed..  The vote will take place on Tuesday, 24 November 2009..
