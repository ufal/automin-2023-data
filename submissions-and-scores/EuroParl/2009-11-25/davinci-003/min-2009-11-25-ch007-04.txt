- Bruno Gollnisch, a non-attached Member, raised a point of order based on Rule 24(2) of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure
- The rule provides for the non-attached Members to appoint one of their own as a delegate to the Conference of Presidents
- Amendment 86 proposed to change this provision to allow the President to decide which of the representatives of the non-attached Members should sit in the Conference of Presidents
- Gollnisch argued that this was a "real disgrace" and that the non-attached Members were the only ones to have the appointment of their representative to the Conference of Presidents imposed on them
- The President asked the rapporteur to comment, to which the rapporteur responded that the non-attached Members should attend the committees to which they are entitled and that the President should invite a non-attached Member to attend the Conference of Presidents
