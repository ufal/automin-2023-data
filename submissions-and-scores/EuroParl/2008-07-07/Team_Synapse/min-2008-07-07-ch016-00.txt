SUMMARY
- The Committee on Budgets is concerned with the 2009 Preliminary draft budget for the European Union for the year 2009.
- Jutta Haug criticises the Commission's proposal.
- The European Parliament wants to prepare itself in a small way for the amended procedure after the Reform Treaty.
- Parliament wants a proper budget to implement the European priorities.
- The 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget was prepared by the Commission within the limits of the financial programming period 2007-2013.
- The Commission will table an amendment to the draft, providing accurate calculations for the financing of Palestine and Kosovo in the near future.
- For the first time, there is a list of new pilot projects and preparatory actions at this early stage.
- Next week there will be a tripartite meeting and the first conciliation meeting to prepare for first reading in the Council.
- PERSON078 is dissatisfied with heading 4 of the draft budget for 2009.

- The portion reserved for external relations and development was cut in the preliminary draft budget.
- Palestine, the Middle East, Kosovo, food aid and macrofinancial assistance are underestimated.
- The food crisis and the effects of climate change are a priority for the EU.
- The rapporteur for the budget for development cooperation wants an increase in the budget under heading 4.
- There is a discrepancy between the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy and what is actually being proposed in the budget for climate and energy policy.
- The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is concerned at the inadequate margin, 82 million under heading 1A.
- The Commission proposes 30 million as a first allocation for the energy and climate policy, but it is proposed that the money be taken from the cooperation programme of the Seventh Framework Programme and its energy section.
- PERSON083 is grateful for Mrs Haug's report summarising what Parliament thinks about the Preliminary Draft Budget.
- The People's Party wants value to be generated from budgetary expenditure, so it is prepared to act in the interests of greater efficiency.
- The surplus in the agriculture budget is changing due to the impact of global markets.
- The new Member States will have to wait ten years before they receive the same support as the old ones, so competition will be distorted.
- This week Parliament is deciding on the political priorities of the budget for 2009.
- The rapporteur, Mrs Haug, has managed to anticipate the stages of the budgetary procedure.
- She has helped Parliament to understand and discuss the priorities of parliamentary committees and political groups.
- She deplores the Council's lack of ambition and systematic nature of the cuts to the Commission's preliminary draft budget.
- PERSON085 thanks Mrs Haug for her cooperation on the report.
- He supports a few amendments to the 2009 EU budget.

- The least flexibility is in section four.
- Member States' governments are not drawing on budgetary resources.
- The gap is gradually opening up between the long-term budget forecast and budget reality.
- The budget for 2009 is having an unpredicted impact on the draft budget.

- Headings 4, 5 and 6 deserve special attention as they are under-financed.
- PERSON094 is in the process of setting a clear mandate for negotiations on the discussions with the Council next week.
- The four main issues that concern citizens are high prices, climate change, competitiveness and environment, Frontex and immigration.
- The draft budget for 2009 allows for the consolidation of programmes approved for the financial period of 2007 to 2013 and puts new emphasis on the need to resolve urgent issues.
- PERSON096 has a lot of respect for Mrs Haug's presentation of the budgetary report.
- The report was voted through unanimously in the Committee on Budgets and aims to clarify Parliament's need for transparency and clarity in preparation for the 2009 budget.
- The total amount of commitment appropriations is increasing to EUR 134.4 billion, which is a 3.1% increase.
- The amount of payment appropriations for EU cohesion policy is decreasing by 3.3%, and the amount of resources proposed for EU as a Global Player is insufficient.
