- The European Parliament and European Commission see the necessity to cover some modest forms of cooperation between the EU and developing countries, such as exchange programs between universities.
- The budget for development is not meant for this kind of cooperation.
- Some Members insist on using a legal base that would lead to finance these actions with the development budget.
- No agreement has been reached on the legal base.
- The rapporteur suggests referring the report back to the Committee on Development to agree on a legal base with the support of a clear majority.
