- The European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism has raised concerns over passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy.
- Since 2000, there have been 77 airline bankruptcies in the European Union.
- The collapse of SkyEurope airline left passengers stranded without accommodation or flights home, and many were told they would not receive compensation or refunds.
- The current system does not cover passengers who book online for seat-only airline flights.
- The Committee has suggested the establishment of a reserve compensation fund to protect passengers in the event of airline insolvency.
