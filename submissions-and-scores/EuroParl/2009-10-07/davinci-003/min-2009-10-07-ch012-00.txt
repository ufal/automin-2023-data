- Request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to not wind up the debate with the tabling of motions for resolutions
- Debate should serve a purpose and a resolution should be adopted after the debate
- Motion for there not to be a resolution because the debate should encompass Europe and not just Italy
- Debate to take place tomorrow and a resolution on the freedom of information in Europe should be voted on
