Meeting KeyPoints:

Last year over 200000 passengers were left stranded at airports with no accommodation and no way home due to the bankruptcy of Excel Airways.  There is clearly a need for EU passenger protection in the event of airline bankruptcy.
1. The matter has been raised with the Commission and the idea of a reserve compensation fund has been proposed.
2. The public should use all the regulations in the most effective way even if they are incomplete.
3. The public should be advised of their rights and have their claims settled without any disparities.
There will be several impacts of bankruptcy on passengers. The most visible is that there might be some delays in getting a refund or a re-routing to another route. Less visible is the uncertainty of the airline's financial health. Some airlines are trying to raise more money by increasing service charges, but this also increase the risk of bankruptcy in the long run. The third impact is the changes of the bankruptcy laws in some countries. These bankruptcy laws are not exactly the same but tend to provide protection to
- The number of airline bankruptcies has gone up in the last 7 years since 2000.
- There is a need to have a protective mechanism at European level to ensure stranded passengers are not left out in the cold in the case of airline bankruptcy.
- The European Commission is
1.  The issue of insolvency of airlines needs to be addressed.
2.  We want to uphold consumer rights but also want consumers to have choice.
3.  Over-regulation may hinder innovation.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism agreed that financial guarantees should be offered to passengers for delayed and missed flights. 

The Committee also agreed that guarantees should cover compensation for denied boarding and for missing checked-in baggage.
- Hundreds of passengers are currently stranded at destinations they were planning on returning home to but their airline went bankrupt;
- The problem is not limited to low cost carriers;
- It is a matter of capital adequacy and insurance for return journeys;
- The solution to passengers' problems will require a different solution which will require appropriate instruments;
- The bankruptcy of the airline companies will require a different solution;
- A rapid solution will be found
- Artur Zasada: Madam President, Commissioner, the fact that the obligations of airlines to their passengers do not terminate even if the airline goes bankrupt is obvious, and should be taken as a starting point in this much needed discussion which Mr Simpson has initiated.
- SkyEurope was one of the largest bankruptcies in the air transport sector in the last couple of years
- According to the representative of the committee responsible for transport, passengers who did not purchase tickets with a credit card had practically no chance of recovering their money
- If customers lose money due to the bankruptcy of SkyEurope, they should launch themselves down the slippery slope
The oral question we are debating this evening reveals, as many have said, the existence of a real legal vacuum, which leaves passengers with no guarantee should an airline go bankrupt. Certainly, European legislation protects passengers who have purchased their ticket as part of a package holiday, but it does not protect those who buy their ticket on the Internet. As Mr El Khadraoui said, consumer behaviour has evolved with the development of the Internet, and the legislator must follow this evolution in order to
Firstly, I would like to say that this is an extremely important topic and one that the EU should be addressing. The fact that this issue is not currently addressed under EU legislation is a missed opportunity. I fully support the idea proposed by Commissioner Gurmai of establishing a mandatory insurance policy for all passengers who board an airline which subsequently collapses. Such a policy would protect all passengers against financial losses in the event of a airline collapse and would be a concrete measure in support of the principle of consumer
1. The airline industry has a stable financial background.
2. The safety of consumers should not only be considered in case of accidents but also in case of insolvency.
3. There have been almost 80 airline bankruptcies in Europe since 2000.
4. A clear regulation for the protection of consumers from the consequences of airline bankruptcies is necessary.
5. The example of SkyEurope demonstrates the need for a clear regulation
* The EU27 transport ministers have agreed to start Single European Sky reform in 2020, 20 months earlier than originally planned
* The EU has created a new model for private airlines, meaning state-owned companies no longer have to be bailed out if they run into trouble
* The EU plans to introduce safeguards for passengers when an airline goes bankrupt, but not due to safety violations
* The EU wants to introduce rights for sea and river transport passengers, which is a choice made by the EU
1. The airline sector needs to be addressed through tightening up existing regulations
2. Financial and operating accounts for low-cost airlines need to be scrutinized more closely
3. We need to increase transparency surrounding airline flight policies and customer complaint handling 
4. We must facilitate cross-border compensation claims
5. Better regulation of cross-border complaints would demonstrate the EU's commitment to consumer
