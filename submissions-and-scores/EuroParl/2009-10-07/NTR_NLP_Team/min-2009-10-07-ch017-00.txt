Last night in the EU as Patrice Tirolien was speaking there were worrying developments concerning the political situation and security in Guinea requiring a firm response by the European Union. As you know 28 September 2009 troops under the Guinean Government carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration uniting all of the opposition parties, causing 157 deaths and injuring more than a thousand people, some of whom suffered particularly vile instances of rape and mutilation. The Republic of Guinea is a country that has
1. The meeting transcript shows that Camara refused to raise the issue of whether he would stand for the Guinean Presidency. This is a sign of things to come since the current escalation is to have elections in spring 2010.
2. The international community has unanimously condemned the violent actions and the Guinean regime's intentions to eliminate all forms of democratic opposition.
3. The European Parliament would like to know the decisions the Council intends to take to address the situation.

The victims of the recent violence in Guinea deserve our support and justice.  The Commission of Inquiry proposed by Guinea's president will be a start, but the Guinean Government must also face justice for the atrocities committed.  The international court of justice, the International Criminal Court, is an option for justice, and the Guinean people should be aware of this.  We reject the proposed fisheries partnership agreement with Guinea, and ask that future negotiations focus on the needs of the people
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr. Buzek and the European Parliament for having accepted my request for a debate on the human rights situation in Guinea. 
I was particularly moved by the attention devoted to human rights in the debates held during this session. As a human rights campaigner, I cannot be indifferent to the events in Guinea.
I note the presence of officials from the High Commission for Justice and Peace of Guinea. I would like to ask them what is happening

1. I find it remarkable that the European Union is maintaining its fisheries agreement with Guinea, as the agreement was entered into with the previous regime two weeks before the coup.
2. We have, in fact, stuck to an agreement that we entered into with a lawful regime, but now there is a military dictatorship.
3. We have stuck to this all year, but yesterday the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, openly urged Moussa Dadis Camara and his regime
The President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaor√©, has been appointed as a mediator in the Burkina Faso-Guinea fisheries dispute.  Chris Davies: I believe that he must be supported by our diplomatic efforts.  Chris Davies: Mr President, I must correct Mrs Joly when she said that the Committee on Fisheries voted unanimously to reject this proposed partnership agreement with Guinea..  In fact, it voted by just one vote to do so.  Quite
I thank the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for this opportunity to clarify our positions regarding the situation in Guinea. I would like to begin by making clear that the European Union stands with the people of Guinea and denounces strongly the attack by the Guinean army on the democratic protesters, resulting in the killing of civilians. These acts cannot be justified and must be condemned by all. We call for a full, impartial and independent investigation into these acts. The European Union will continue to demand that Captain
