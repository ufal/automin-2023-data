Meeting KeyPoints:

More than 300 people were drowned when a number of refugee boats went down in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya. Some of the refugees were rescued by the Egyptian and Libyan authorities, and some bodies have been recovered, but hundreds of people are still missing. I would like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to say how deeply shocked and saddened we are by this event.
