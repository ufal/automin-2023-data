Meeting KeyPoints:

- This evening we have reached a compromise agreement with the Council which means that the European Parliament can give its consent to the ban on exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury. However, the compromise agreement is at risk if Amendments 37 and 41 are accepted.
- In the Council, not even the Spanish Government insisted on these amendments. I therefore call on you to reject these amendments so that we can make good the significant progress achieved in our agreement with the Council over protecting the environment and public health
