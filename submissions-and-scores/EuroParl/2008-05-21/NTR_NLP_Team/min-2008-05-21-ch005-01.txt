Meeting KeyPoints:

- The proposed part-session from 20-23 April 2009 is not in response to any request from the Orthodox Church, but instead is proposed in a spirit of compromise and goodwill towards the Orthodox Church.
- There was no formal proposal from any groups to hold a part-session of the European Parliament in the proposed week, but rather the suggestion was made by several MEPs on behalf of their groups.

1.	Hartmut Nassauer made a problem which affects the vote and needs to be discussed and resolved.  There is a reference to the date of the elections in the proposed calendar, and some countries have concerns that if the constituent sitting takes place in July 2009, some Members will not achieve the requisite 5 years for pension rights.  In some countries, they use the legislative term but not a fixed period because the legislative terms vary in length.
