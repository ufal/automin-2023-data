- The European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs adopted a new recital 12a regarding environmental damage and criminal liability.
- The recital states that the perpetrator's intention or negligence should be determined by the time they became aware of the facts constituting the offence, not when the activity commenced.
- The prior grant of an authorization, license, or concession should not be a defense in such circumstances.
- Both the Council and the Commission understand the intentions expressed in the amendment and believe that Member States will take these intentions into consideration.
- The declarations form part of a compromise agreed upon, and the legislative success is expected to be achieved at the first reading.
