SUMMARY
- There is a risk that the compromise on Almad√©n may collapse, if Amendments 37 and 41 are approved.
- Neither the Council nor the Commission accepts these amendments.
- A year ago, the Council accepted only one of the European Parliament's amendments.
- Now, with the cooperation of all the political groups, they succeeded in having 22 amendments accepted in the text of the agreement.
