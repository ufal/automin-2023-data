ATTENDEES : PERSON155, PERSON158


SUMMARY
- PERSON155 proposes an oral amendment to the Kurdish language in Turkey.
- It would read: 'There are real possibilities to learn Kurdish within the public and private schooling system and to use it in broadcasting, in daily life and in access to public services'.
- It would also drop the word 'neighbouring' because they want the Ombudsman to work with all European ombudsmanmen and ombudswomen.
