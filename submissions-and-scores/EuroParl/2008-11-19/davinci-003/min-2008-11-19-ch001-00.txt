(FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent report. I think it is important to remember that the euro has been a great success story for Europe. It has enabled us to have low inflation, low interest rates and a stable macroeconomic environment. It has also enabled us to create jobs and reduce public deficits.
<P>
However, I think it is important to remember that the euro is not the only factor in the current economic crisis. We must also look at the global economic situation and the role of the US dollar in this crisis. We must also look at the role of the financial markets and the role of the banking sector in this crisis.
<P>
Finally, I think it is important to remember that the euro is not a panacea for all our economic problems. We must look at the long-term economic development of Europe and ensure that we have the right policies in place to ensure that the euro remains a strong and stable currency.

- The euro is not the only factor in the current economic crisis, other factors include the global economic situation, the role of the US dollar, the role of the financial markets and the role of the banking sector
- The euro is not a panacea for all economic problems, long-term economic development of Europe must be ensured
- Urgent action must be taken both within the EU and globally to address the current crisis
