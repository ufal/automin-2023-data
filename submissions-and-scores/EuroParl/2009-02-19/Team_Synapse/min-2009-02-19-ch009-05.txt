ATTENDEES : PERSON108, PERSON109, PERSON110


SUMMARY
- PERSON108 wants to refer the report back to the Committee on Development under Rule 168(2).
- The report covers some modest forms of cooperation between the EU and developing countries, such as exchange programmes between universities here and there.
- The budget for development is not meant for this kind of cooperation, but some Members insist on using a legal base that would lead us to finance these actions with the development budget.
- There are differences of interpretation.
