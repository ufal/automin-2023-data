SUMMARY
- The 7th European Union-Mongolia Interparliamentary meeting has strengthened the relationship between the European Parliament and the Mongolian Parliament.
- The visitors have had an opportunity to experience, at first hand, the workings of the Parliament in Brussels and I wish the delegation well for the remainder of their stay in the European Union.
