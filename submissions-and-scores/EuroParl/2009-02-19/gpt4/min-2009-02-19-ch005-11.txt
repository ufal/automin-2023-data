- Situation in Sri Lanka discussed in the meeting
- Confusion over the wording of the oral amendment
- Original wording said 'non-fire period', changed to 'cease-fire'
- Official text from the Declaration of the Co-Chairs uses 'no-fire' period
- Amendment to paragraph 2: 'Believes that a military victory over the LTTE, as envisaged by the Government of Sri Lanka, will not obviate the need to find a political solution in order to ensure a lasting peace'
- Recital K, as amended orally: 'whereas the Tokyo Co-Chairs have called jointly on the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to declare a no-fire period to allow for evacuation of the sick and wounded and provision of humanitarian aid to civilians,'
