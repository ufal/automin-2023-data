Thank you Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, for this great confidence you have shown me and for this vote of confidence. I am enormously honoured and I take this vote of confidence as a sign that the European Parliament agrees with my ambitious agenda for the next five years.
As President of the European Commission, my party will be Europe and it will be made up of all those who want to come on this exciting journey to make a united Europe. I thank the Group of the European People
