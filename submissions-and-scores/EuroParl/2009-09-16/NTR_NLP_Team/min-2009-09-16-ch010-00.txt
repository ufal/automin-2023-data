Meeting KeyPoints:

A capital requirements directive, a regulation on credit rating agencies, a new regulation on cross-border payments, and a decision establishing a new programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and audit. The directive and the regulations are aimed at protecting EU investors and the European Union's financial system, and at increasing consumer rights guarantees and ensuring better supervision. These acts are aimed at stabilising the financial markets. We are thereby fulfilling the predictions, but the legislation we are signing was drawn
