15. Order of business

The next item was the order of business.
The final draft agenda for the September 2009 sittings (PE 427.526/PDOJ)
had been distributed and a number of changes had been proposed (Rule 140):

Monday

No changes.
Tuesday

No changes.
Bruno Gollnisch asked the President to call a meeting of non-attached
Members to allow them to nominate their representative on the Conference of
Presidents (the President replied that this would be done during the
present part-session).

Wednesday

Request by the Verts/ALE Group to postpone the election of the President of
the Commission (item 17 on the final draft agenda) until after the Irish
referendum of 2 October 2009 on the Lisbon Treaty.

The following spoke: Daniel Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,
who moved the request, Martin Schulz, on behalf of the S-D Group, and
Joseph Daul, on behalf of the PPE Group.

By roll-call vote (135 in favour, 248 against, 14 abstentions), Parliament
rejected the request.

Vronique De Keyser, Diane Dodds, Jan Zahradil, Kay Swinburne and Michle
Striffler had made it known that their voting machines had not worked.

Thursday

The order of business was thus established.
