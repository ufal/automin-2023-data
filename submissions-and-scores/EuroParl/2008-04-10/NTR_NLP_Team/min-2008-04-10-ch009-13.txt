Meeting KeyPoints:

The PSE Group fully supports the report by Mr Swoboda, although we believe that a solution can be found within a week. We want to work with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur to find a solution so that we can take a vote during the next Strasbourg part-session. We are committed to finding a compromise that makes it possible for Parliament to vote in favour of the resolution during the next Strasbourg part-session.
