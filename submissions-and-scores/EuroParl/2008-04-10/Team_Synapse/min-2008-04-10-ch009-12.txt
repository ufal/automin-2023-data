SUMMARY
- The PPE-DE has withdrawn Amendment 4, but would like to vote on paragraph 8 in two parts.
- The first part would go as far as 'on public opinion in Croatia' and the second part would begin with 'urges the Croatian Government'.
- After yesterday's debate in the House, a large majority would be in favour of replacing the word 'could' with 'should in any case'.
