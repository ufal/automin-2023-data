Meeting KeyPoints:

The ten-year anniversary of the adoption of the EU Treaty - the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) -  will certainly be a subject for discussion in the European Parliament. My political group, in collaboration with the economic and monetary affairs committee, has proposed a resolution on the EMU’s first ten years and its impact on the real economy.
President. -
   The next item is the debate on the report by Pervenche Berès, on the evaluation of the first
- The crisis has reopened the discussion on the need to reform the EU after its enlargement. The EU has to be capable of handling future enlargements without major concerns.
- The crisis has made the member states re-think the way they operate the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The report reflects this: the report stresses that the real economy and the financial markets are inter-connected and calls
1. For too long we have adopted a passive attitude. We, the European Parliament, are more than willing to play our part in this exercise.
2. The euro has been an unqualified success. Decisions could be drafted quickly, implemented promptly and, in particular, acted as examples for all 27 Member States.
3. Behind all the positive responses to the euro, the question of what is to happen next still
- The quality of the report on the tenth anniversary of Economic and Monetary Union is to be congratulated.
- Cooperation between the various political groups in Parliament should also be congratulated.
- The Economic and Monetary Union has existed for ten years.
- The starting point for the Commission's analysis and the report was the evaluation of the past ten years of Economic and Monetary Union.
- The current economic and monetary union (EMU) has been very positive during the first ten years since its introduction.
- Cooperation among the EU countries has proven useful in tackling the current difficult economic situation.
- Coordination between fiscal policies of the EU countries is a key element in effectively tackling the current economic situation.
- We will be discussing this in coming months and, for this reason, as you know, the Commission will, on 26 November, present an action plan incorporating objectives, instruments, policies and commitments
- This plan will indicate the need to adapt the national programmes in order to unite national policies and make them convergent and consistent with a European strategy, policies and instruments
- This is also an issue of governance
- I totally agree with many of the governance aspects that you have included in your report and
I would like to point out that enthusiasm for the single currency is high today compared to years past. However, I would like to state that it is still a highly controversial subject as to the extent that the divergences between the EU member states negatively impacts the currency. There is no hard evidence to show this to be a fact. Regarding the quote, I would need more context to fully understand what the report was stating.
In summary, from the meeting, we can gather that Mr. Trichet, the ECB president, had the following comments:
- Regarding the automobile sector, he believes the different governments in the Euro Zone should coordinate their actions.
- He believes the Euro Zone members should set an example in demonstrating the sincerity of their words in coordinating economic policies by coordinating their national actions when it comes to taking initiatives in the automobile sector.
- He believes the rest of the discussion is "
- We should always be ready to represent the Eurozone at the G20, IMF and the FSF
- We should always have a permanent and long-term presence of the ECB and the Commission at the G20
- We should not hesitate to accept someone else as President of the Eurogroup if the current one is modestly trying to lead the finance ministers' work
- We should not forget that the Eurozone is a major economic union and that the economic and monetary union should be
There were several points that were raised during the meeting that are worth highlighting.  First, no one can dispute the fact that there is a link between monetary policy and trade policy.  Higher stable currency values lead to more stable prices which in turn leads to increased confidence among businesses that prices will be stable, which in turn lead to increased demand for the currency and higher currency values.  Notably, many companies have pointed to the Euro's higher value over the past few years as a limiting factor
* The euro is an undeniable success
* The euro is a strategic text and this analysis was vital
* The 10 year anniversary of the introduction of the euro saw comments from several leaders and MPs encouraging or discouraging the continued success of the project.  It is clear that the euro is not discouraged and will continue to stand tall.
* The introduction of the euro to 11 countries was followed by further additions to form the Eurozone of 15 and then 16
1. The most powerful European countries have already taken steps to stimulate their national economies.
2. Europe is more than the sum of its national policies.
3. The time has come to make the euro one of Europe's central tools to ensure a robust currency and also a robust real economy.
4. Coordinating national policies is not enough. More needs to be done to ensure that economic policies in the euro area are more closely coordinated.
5. Having a Lisbon Strategy that is purely
- The European Central Bank (ECB) has passed the test of this financial crisis with flying colours. It has acted quickly and decisively to deal with the crisis, and has shown itself to be a strong central bank.
- The euro has been a strong currency and helped the Euro Zone to remain stable. It has even been able to give a helping hand to certain countries outside the Euro Zone.
- Countries outside
1.	We are confident that the financial crisis will ultimately strengthen, rather than weaken, the monetary union.
2.	Eoin Ryan, on behalf of the UEN Group, welcomes the initiative taken at the weekend and the outcome of that.
My second remark relates to the topic of coordination. I believe that the euro is a success, particularly from a political point of view, because it gives the European Union the status of a political power. However, I also believe that its coordination is not working very well, and this, at least, on three points. The first point is the issue of taxation. You know what the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance's opinion is on this matter: we are in favour of tax competition within
Sahra Wagenknecht, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, gave a speech about the crisis in the Eurozone and the role of the European Union during the last 10 years. She mentioned three major mistakes that the EU made when introducing the Euro:
1. Setting up Economic and Monetary Union without setting up fiscal and tax policy.
2. Not introducing democratic supervision for the European Central Bank.
3. Giving the European Central Bank's mandate solely to
First ten years of the Euro Zone have been associated with high levels of unemployment, reduced growth, huge monetary cost, and questionable socio-economic benefit. In light of these outcomes, it is evident that the Euro Zone has not been tested in hard times. On the other hand, it is apparent that the increase in trade between the Euro Zone countries could be fairly large, perhaps even 3-4% of GNP. However, the marginal benefit of this increase in trade is minute, perhaps 3-

* Greece and Germany bond spread has widened over 150 bps over the past few weeks
* The last time the spread was this wide was during the Eurozone financial crisis of 2010-2011
* The spread is unsustainable and shows a lack of confidence in the Eurozone and the single currency
* The question for us isn't how long the Euro will last, but which country will leave first
1.  The economic crisis that began in 2008 has exposed the several weaknesses within the European Union’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).  One of the biggest weaknesses has been the lack of cooperation among the EU’s member states, which has made it more difficult to combat the crisis.  An important part of addressing this weakness will be to improve the cooperative nature of the EU’s monetary policy.  To do this, the EU will need to adopt a more united approach to
-- The ten years of Economic and Monetary Union should be assessed from an international perspective.
-- The Euro Zone has not showed its advantages over its main competitors, the USA and Asia. This means that the Euro Zone balance sheet is in the red.
-- While the European Union has developed more slowly than its competitors, the future of the Euro Zone places increasing emphasis on imposing uniform economic policies on the Member States, particularly with respect to budgetary and fiscal policies.
-- The declaration is of
The most important takeaways from the Council meeting were:
1.  Central Banks should not impose policies that slow economic growth in all Member States, as this would harm the eurozone as a whole
2.  The main criticism of the European Central Bank is that it is ignoring the economic problems of the regions and the less developed Member States
3.  Developing and closing the gap with the old Member States would require a stronger Economic and Monetary Union that creates the appropriate incentives
1.	The long period of economic and monetary union has failed to take into account the social aspects that were previously considered.
2.	The European Commission is advocating for a more decisive role for the International Monetary Fund while at the same time rejecting the state in relation to the economic policy. 
3.	The monetary policy has failed because of the speculation against the currency.
1. Economists are of the opinion that an expansive finance policy should be pursued
2. If we want to use it as a tool, we need many individual economic policies
3. 'One size fits all' will never fit anyone very well
4. It will always be a poor fit for everyone
5. Finally, Andreas Mölzer said that the Danish economy is as solid as a rock and that we have managed the
1.	The 10 year old who created the Euro could not have imagined such a strong currency.
2	We can now feel the benefits of EU membership in a world where globalization has caused many pains. 
3	The strict rules for EU membership should not become harsher. 
4	Sweden was able to recover by becoming part of the EU but it would have been foolish to join the Euro.
- Sweden joined the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999. While the move was initially met with strong opposition from Swedes, the country now perceives it as a positive move as the country gained greater stability and stronger economic growth as a result of joining the euro area.
- During the European debt crisis in 2012, Sweden left the euro area due to the lack of joint response from the group of euro area countries. The decision was politically contested as it would have involved high financial contribution
1. The introduction of the euro was a success. Unemployment has fallen and employment has gone up. This is due to the stability of the euro and the fact that the country is using the euro as its currency.
2. Hungary is an exception. It has a high money supply and a low income. It is not using the fiscal consolidation program consistently.
3. We should examine why the Euro Zone did not succeed in achieving convergence. Measures should be taken against countries who have continually
- The Slovak government is preparing measures to strengthen regulatory and supervisory framework. The Parliament of the EU has urged the Commission to propose similar measures for all EU members.
- The current crisis on the financial markets is a risk to which currency speculators want to avoid putting their currencies. When the exchange rates of neighbouring countries fall, the one with the higher risk attracts capital from those countries. 
- Denmark, which has high employment rate, is
- Mr Ryszard Czarnecki thanked the European Commission and the European Central Bank for their report but noted that the Euro Stat announcement on a recession starting in the Euro Zone was worrisome
- Mr Margaritis Schinas disagreed, noting that EMU and the euro represented a successful compromise between the anti-inflationary policies of the non-euro countries and the need for a more stringent approach towards inflation in the Euro Zone countries
- Both agreed that the road to
- The global financial crisis (GFC) and the Eurozone's response to it has been a success for Europe and a failure for humanity;
- Coordinating a resolution to future crises and passing a new EU Treaty to manage economic governance beyond the EU is a necessity to maintain Europe's success;
- Failing to control financial sectors led to the GFC and calls for new regulations are not unreasonable;
The euro has been a resounding success. It is the second most important currency in the world, inflation in the first 10 years has broadly been in line with the ECB's objective of 2%. Furthermore, it has facilitated travel, trade and employment. The announcement last week that the Euro Zone is in recession now means that urgent action will have to be taken both within the EU and globally. However, the one thing we cannot do is blame the euro for the current crisis. While the Stability
- The failure of financial institutions (both public and private) was largely responsible for the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
- The EU has proven to be effective in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
- Specifically, the creation of the EU's economic and monetary union served as a stabilizing force during the financial crisis.
1. Slovakian President confirmed that the government of Slovakia will consider the recommendations of the European Parliament for the future financial stability of the EU. It does not intend to burden the country with future debts and would not meddle in pension reform attempts to achieve savings of private savers and achieve short-term improvement in the public finance deficit. It will not pass any laws that would conflict with market rules and would
- The two reports agreed differing views on the likely impact of Brexit on the UK economy.  The reports agree that the economy will suffer, though the EU report estimates that the economy will suffer less than if Britain remained in the EU
- It has always been the case that joining the EU requires all member states to adopt the Euro currency, though the UK has paid less into the EU budget than other members.  The UK voted to leave the EU, so it will not join the EU.
There was broad consensus for continuing with the Economic and Monetary Union project and the single currency. There was broad support for two key things, namely, the need for the ECB to remain independent and for the Stability and Growth Pact to be expanded.
1. The core of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) should be preserved and strengthened. Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) needs to be maintained as it is now following the 2005 revision. Budget discipline and fiscal rules should be maintained. Fiscal stimulus coordination should be facilitated to make it effective, but not jeopardise the sustainability of public accounts.
2. European voice for the stability of the euro should be strengthened
Based on the summary provided by Juncker, there are a few key takeaways that can be extracted:
- There was near unanimous agreement amongst politicians from countries that use the Euro that the currency has been a success thus far
- Those countries that have joined the Euro Zone have largely agreed that the decision was a good one, and that the additional political will invested was worthwhile
- Juncker was praised for his apparent success in navigating the European Parliament in presenting his case for action against the financial crisis
- All those who are demanding greater coordination of economic policies must of course work towards this by trying not to anticipate economic policy decisions that they have not referred to their colleagues from the Eurogroup.
- It is easy, within Parliament, to call for the coordination of economic policies. I would propose to you, on the basis of your Rules of Procedure, that you put forward an intergroup text in which the large groups, acting as the
Thank you Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. President, let me just make a couple of remarks on the divergence question. First, I agree with the Commission's statement that divergence is to be expected for some of the Eurozone countries because of their public finances. However, I disagree with the statement that divergence is now also to be expected in the United Kingdom. The British economy is performing well, their inflation rate is quite low, their debt to GDP ratio is declining and they are the

- We want to work with Google. 
- President: The debate is closed. 
- vote will take place on Tuesday 18 November 2008 at 12 noon.
