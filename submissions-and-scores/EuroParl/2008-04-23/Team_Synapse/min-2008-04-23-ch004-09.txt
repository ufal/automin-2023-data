ATTENDEES : PERSON094, PERSON095


SUMMARY
- "FYROM" has never been the name of any country.
- It can only be an abbreviation of "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".
- In the previous report, adopted by the plenary meeting of this Parliament on 12 July 2007, it was decided not to introduce the use of this abbreviation as a name but only to use those five words.
- The oral amendment proposed by Mr Landsbergis is not in line with this decision.
- PERSON095 proposes to correct the situation with the text of the report by inserting an additional explanation.
