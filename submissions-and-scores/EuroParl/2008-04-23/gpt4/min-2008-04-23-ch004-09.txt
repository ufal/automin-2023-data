- The meeting discussed the complicated situation concerning the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
- The abbreviation 'FYROM' has never been the name of any country and is only an abbreviation of 'former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'.
- The previous report decided not to introduce the use of this abbreviation as a name but only to use those five words.
- The oral amendment proposed by Mr Landsbergis is not in line with this decision.
- It is expected that during 2008 an agreement with Greece will solve the different views on the names of this state and that then the term FYROM will be forgotten forever.
