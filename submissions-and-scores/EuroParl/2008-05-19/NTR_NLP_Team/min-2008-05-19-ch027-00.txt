Meeting KeyPoints:

Following the adoption of the Consumer Policy Strategy 2007-2013, Mr President, I would like to provide a brief overview of the main conclusions of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
The next topic is the report by Mr Lehtinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the EU Consumer Policy strategy 2007-2013.
The report welcomes the Consumer Policy Strategy and focuses on five main areas: improving consumer confidence and trust; strengthening consumer rights and
- Member of the Commission Meglena Kuneva welcomed the view of Parliament on the necessity to transform the 27 national mini-markets into a pan-European retail market, the largest in the world
- Through our endeavours and substantial efforts, helped by the set of our strategy, we could step by step achieve this goal. She particularly welcomed the agreement on the need for targeted full harmonisation where bott
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to welcome the upcoming communication on consumer policy as this is a very important subject that needs to be addressed at EU level. Moreover, both the report as well as the draft opinion provide an overall balanced view on this topic.
The draft opinion correctly highlights the need to further complete the internal market and to enforce the right of consumers to have access to a range of choices. Moreover, it rightly states that EU-wide competition and consumer policy can protect and
Consumer empowerment is a central element of this report, and consumers need to be empowered with the skills and tools needed to use and benefit from the digital environment safely.

There is a strong need for easy and effective access to redress for consumers in the EU. Special attention should be given to non-judicial forms of redress.
1. We should ensure that the rules governing the symbol are formulated so as to enable consumers to rely on the safety of products bearing the EE mark
3. It is essential that we not only encourage the Commission to examine and develop such a system but actually urge it to do so and provide us with an appropriate draft legislation
4. There are few contentious points
1.  Given the multiple problems related to PSE dogma, such as the unclear legal basis, the contract law issue, the role of the Ombudsman, opting in or opting out, and many more, it is clear that the pro-consumers should have their say in this matter.
2. Furthermore, the UEN Group strongly believes that PSE dogma should be maintained at all costs and should not be questioned. This approach is unlikely to lead to a
- The greatest problem for consumers today is that it is difficult to get a dispute between different countries heard because there are no instances to resolve such cross-border disputes.
- The EU must first develop instances to resolve disputes, not create more EU legislation.
- I think the proposal to appoint an EU consumer ombudsman is highly dubious.
- Why introduce more services to be financed at EU level, thereby risking a cut in appropriations for
Consumers have found it easier to compare prices in cross-border contracts and welcomed the increased retail potential in the internal market.  I agree that the new Member States should be encouraged to continue their reforms and that they should be able to adopt the euro as soon as they fulfil the Maastricht criteria, in order to take full advantage of a common currency in the internal market.  The European Parliament will soon have an opportunity to test this proposal in practice when it debates the enlargement of the euro zone
The European Parliament supports the call for a thorough study of the existing systems in the Member States and an assessment of the need of a European collective redress system. The existence of this system, either at EU or national level, would lead to disproportionate consequences on the internal market and its consumers and businesses, without clear indication that it would add value to the internal market and its consumers. The Parliament therefore requests the Commission to carry out the study and present its results to Parliament and the Member States. The Parliament
- Consumer interests are less well protected in the current legal framework, especially with cross-border transactions
- A horizontal approach to consumer policy is required, but there should be clear guidelines, uniform standards and a clear reference framework to enable consumers to have confidence in the law
- If time limits vary from one jurisdiction to another, consumers' confidence will wane
- If studies on the enforcement of consumer rights only analyse the
Malcolm Harbour thanked Lasse Lehtinen for a very comprehensive report which contained an enormous amount of extremely significant ideas.

He wanted to thank the rapporteur, who he understood was Lasse Lehtinen, and the Commissioner for giving due consideration to the concerns raised in the European Parliament during the course of this review.

He then went on to say that he wanted to invite the Commission to carry out further research into the issue of collective redress, and that he was disappointed
2. There is no need to stress the importance of customer satisfaction for businesses, but consumers should always have the possibility of real choice and changing service provider or seller. 
3. Without a doubt, such choice creates a competitive market in which it does not pay market players to discourage consumers.
4. In a competitive market, the entrepreneur knows that he risks losing his market position
- I welcome the Commission's report on the EU consumer policy strategy and appreciate your efforts, Commissioner Kuneva, to promote a consumer culture based on consumer awareness and better access to information.
- I believe that strong and independent consumer organisations are the backbone of an effective consumer policy and that Parliament's request to provide sufficient finance for consumer organisations is well taken.
- In the context of the European Union consumer protection strategy, I would like to
- The idea of creating a European Ombudsman for consumers is still too new and needs more evaluation
- Although cooperation between consumer agencies could be strengthened, more effort should be made to reduce the number of complaints
- It would be advisable to dedicate more funds to support consumer organizations and supervisory bodies in the European Union
- It is questionable whether a European Ombudsman for consumers would help consumers
Overall, Mr Barnier believes that there is a general consensus on most points, including the need for a more efficient internal market, even in the last months of the current mandate.
It is important to bear in mind, however, that this is a political statement and that several officials remain unconvinced of the efficiency of the internal market. In fact, some members of the European Parliament have even asked for a better overview of the European Commission's actions on the internal market in a new legislative proposal
1. The project is intended to provide two comprehensive studies: one for the parliamentarians, and one for the EU institutions. All the outcomes will be published online.
2. The preparatory work for the three workshops has already started. There will be three huge events for business, consumers and academics to share their ideas before the end of the month. 
3. Several Members raised the idea of a class action, which
Following the introduction of the report, the issue of consumer protection was discussed at some length. 
Three main topics were addressed. First, the importance of the new digital environment and the associated need to educate consumers on their rights. Second, the importance of sector-specific regulations in ensuring high levels of consumer protection. Third, the need for the European Commission to strengthen the position of consumer organisations by establishing a specific European Consumer Ombudsman. 
Roselyne Lefran√ßois asked the
- Consumers must have access to accurate information on which to base their decisions
- An informed consumer is also a more active consumer!
- It is important for consumers to be able to rely on their rights; they should not have to waive them because they do not have the resources to take the providers of goods or services in other countries to court
2. Another issue Katrin Saks mentioned was the incompatibility of
