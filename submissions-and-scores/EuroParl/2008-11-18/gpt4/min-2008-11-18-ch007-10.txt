- The rapporteurs were congratulated for incorporating the need for a financial analysis in defining monetary policy, taking into account the transfer of monetary policy, credit and financial asset development, new product characteristics, and risk and liquidity concentration.
- A 'one size fits all' monetary policy may not suit all Member States, so financial facilities should be introduced for countries experiencing contractive effects due to this policy.
- The Euro Zone has withstood the first wave of the financial crisis, and an economic policy better coordinated among Member States could halt the economic downturn.
- Both economic strategies, state interference and liberal policy, should be used to overcome the economic recession, with a focus on social safety nets and liberal reforms for stronger integration and business expansion opportunities.
- The European Central Bank should not ignore the economic problems of regions and less developed Member States, and a radical change in the Euro Zone's economic doctrine is needed to counteract the financial crisis and promote economic development in all EU Member States.
