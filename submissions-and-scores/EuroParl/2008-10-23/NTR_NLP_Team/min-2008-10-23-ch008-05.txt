Meeting KeyPoints:

1. Human rights, privacy, personal dignity and data protection should be considered with great sensitivity prior to taking any new technical measure.
2. In our view, security and security measures are absolutely essential but the use of scanners or display devices which show people completely naked is totally unacceptable.
3. We oppose any move to expand such measures as this is a violation of human dignity and is not accompanied by any increase in security.
