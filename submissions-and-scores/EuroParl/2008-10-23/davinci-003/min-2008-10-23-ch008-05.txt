- Summarize the meeting:

1. Alojz Peterle, the rapporteur, put seven minuses against the amendments of the Socialist Group due to his credibility and the fact that the amendments were refused in the ENVI Committee three weeks ago.
2. The rapporteur has no problem with the contents of the amendments, but does not think there is any need to repeat some elements in different resolutions.
3. The rapporteur proposed an oral amendment to reorganise the text after the vote.
4. The amendment proposed by the rapporteur includes moving Amendments 1, 3 and 4 after paragraph 32, Amendment 5 after recital M, and Amendment 6 after recital Q.
5. The President summarised the situation, confirming that the rapporteur is not proposing an amendment to the text, but simply wants to ensure that after the vote the services reorganise the final text as he has proposed.
