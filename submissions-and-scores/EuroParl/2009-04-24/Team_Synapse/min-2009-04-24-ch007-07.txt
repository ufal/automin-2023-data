SUMMARY
- The postponement of the Council's autumn discharge procedure should only be accepted if the Council also puts the report on its agenda.
- The Council has not even once yet included these reports on the agenda.
- It would be important to ensure that the Council accepts those regulations which are pending and guarantee transparency in the spending of European funds.
