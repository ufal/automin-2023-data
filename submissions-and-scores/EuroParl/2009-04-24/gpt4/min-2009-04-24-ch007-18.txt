- European Parliament granted discharge to the European Police College
- This decision was against the recommendation made by the rapporteur and the committee
- Rapporteur urged colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to accept amendments tabled by the Socialist Group
- No reason to justify not granting or delaying discharge now that it has been granted
- Rapporteur proposed that the group support the Socialist Group's proposals and vote in favor of the next four amendments
