Meeting KeyPoints:

- The text published on the internet by Parliament's services is incorrect and inconsistent with the text which was tabled in the resolution by my group and others.
- The text which was actually tabled in the resolution by my group and others will be used in the vote.
- Hans-Peter Martin, a Member of the European Parliament, has informed me that far-right radicals are not Members of the European Parliament using their voting cards in the room.
