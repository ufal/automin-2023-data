- Summarize the meeting:

- The joint report of the Council and the Commission for 2008 showed some progress in lifelong learning, but not enough.
- Challenges include students dropping out of education early, poor participation in lifelong learning amongst older and low-skilled workers, and poor skills levels amongst migrant workers.
- Quality of education needs to be improved to equip children and young people for autonomous, creative and innovative thinking and learning.
- Curricula need to be modernized and the use of information technology increased amongst older people.
- Lifelong learning programmes must be related to the economy and support entrepreneurship.
- Governments and institutions of the European Union should not cut resources for education during the financial crisis.
