- The joint report of the Council and the Commission for 2008 shows progress in lifelong learning, but more needs to be done.
- Challenges include early school dropouts, low participation in lifelong learning among older and low-skilled workers, and poor skills levels among migrant workers.
- The quality of education must be improved to promote autonomous, creative, and innovative thinking and learning.
- Lifelong learning programs should support entrepreneurship and consider local and regional needs.
- Governments and EU institutions should not cut resources for education during financial crises, as high-quality education is crucial for combating poverty and finding solutions.
