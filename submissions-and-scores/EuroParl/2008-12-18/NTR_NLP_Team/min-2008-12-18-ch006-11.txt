Meeting KeyPoints:

Tim: We believe that this project will help us establish a beachhead in SF and help us build out later in the year in other markets

Molly: Y Combinator and 500 Startups have both invested in this company before

Elia: He has built similar sandbox cities before with his company Ona

David: We are impressed that this is their 2nd attempt at a city

Marco: He only has about 2-3 years until his next yoga
Herbert Reul: Mr President, on a point of order, we are of course in the process of adopting a decision, a directive, on the basis of a trialogue agreement.  We had a similar state of affairs yesterday with regard to emissions trading.  Today we are rightly putting all the other amendments to the vote separately after adopting the overall decision; which I feel is right and proper.  We did not do so yesterday, and, indeed, I cannot understand why not.
- The three declarations provided by Jacques Barrot can be submitted to the committee
- The text of the declarations can be assessed before a final vote
- The proposal to hold over the final vote until the texts of the declarations have been assessed will be adopted
