- The European Union is considering introducing the Single European Sky reform ahead of schedule to provide practical support to all European airlines and prevent bankruptcies.
- The reform aims to help airlines save fuel and protect their balance sheets.
- Preventing airline bankruptcies would protect passengers against loss and help maintain jobs in the industry.
- The European Commission and Parliament have worked to create a new private airline model, removing the need for state-controlled airlines to be bailed out by the public.
- The EU is also considering adding safeguards for passengers of airlines that shut down due to non-compliance with safety requirements.
