• Companies are going bankrupt in the economic recession, including Lithuanian airline 'FlyLAL'
• European Parliament has adopted legislation providing guarantees and compensation for passengers, but this does not apply if the airline is experiencing financial difficulties
• Commission has recommended that governments should return money to passengers for tickets they have purchased, then later recoup this by subrogation from the bankrupt company
• Debate on proposal of reserve compensation fund
• Discussion of 'sky solidarity' principle of joint responsibility of airlines for passengers
• Consideration of compulsory insurance against bankruptcy for airlines
