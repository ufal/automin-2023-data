Meeting KeyPoints:

- The maintenance of non-transparent systems of income taxation within the European Union is not compatible with free competition and the Commission intends to put a stop to such systems
- Several measures were agreed upon by the European Union in the last decades to tackle the erosion of tax bases and investment allocation distortions, including measures to promote good governance in the tax area
- In April 2009, the European Commission adopted a communication outlining actions to strengthen governance in the tax area, with a view to promoting transparency,
Yes, the European Commission takes the view that it is covered by its written answer of 22.7.2008
The Commission is fully committed to protecting people from earthquakes. This protection must form part of an integrated approach to dealing with situations which may be caused by various dangers. The Commission recently adopted a communication entitled "A Community approach on the prevention of natural and manmade disasters" which covers earthquakes. This communication follows on from the actions taken by the Commission over recent years, which are in line with many of the recommendations formulated by the European Parliament in its resolution in 2007. The specific action relates in particular to the
The European Union has prepared several legislative acts to prevent disasters caused by earthquakes. We are following the communication which you have issued on earthquake prevention, and once we have a response we will examine if this approach or the other approach is better. We are also welcoming your proposals to include specific provisions for nuclear installations in the national laws and the Seveso II directive for industry.
Solar thermal electricity was not excluded from the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) because it was not considered to be urgent enough to be included.  Instead, it was addressed as a matter of urgency due to the threat of energy supply disruptions and due to gas shortages related to a missing physical infrastructure.  Offshore wind, carbon capture and storage and the availability of funding for new entrants into the renewable energy sector were also not excluded as eligible areas for support.
- Will the Commission say what actions and initiatives it intends to take to impose pre-conditions and restrictions in respect of these initiatives, bearing in mind the special geological characteristics, climatic conditions and the possibilities for funding these schemes and their viability?.
- The additional requirements are that each project that is submitted is also analysed by the Commission and we make a recommendation on the projects to be developed.
Following the recent approval of new nuclear power reactors in Europe, including Lithuania, the Commission has asked the directorate-general for energy to provide an update on its activities to assess the implications on nuclear safety, and in particular the impact of the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context. 

Based on the outcome of these activities, the Commission will decide on any additional legislative requirements.

The updated report will be presented to the Commission at the next possible meeting.
At a first reading, the Commission welcomes the progress made by Ireland to promote sustainable energy in cities. A Joint Research Centre will help provide scientific background and technical support. A financial support facility for cities has also been set up. The creation of benchmarking will help smaller cities to develop sustainable energy action plans. The Commission will support these initiatives through the European Investment Bank.
AFramework for cities that share an ambition to develop sustainable models for their citizens has been created called theCovenant of Mayors. 
The Covenant of Mayors includes sympathisers like New York and Rochester, and has participants from other non-EU countries. 
So, it offers a lot of knowledge through the office we operate.
As concerns financial support, we do not at this stage have any programme dedicated to energy efficiency, but we have the Structural Funds, we have
Cities are diverse and have good ideas on how to make their cities sustainable. Stakeholders should take the initiative to develop policies that are city-driven. The creation of Europe-wide instruments for low-carbon energy sources without bottom-up input from cities will fail. The Covenant of Mayors can provide much-needed input and experience to the formulation of policies for sustainable cities.
The Covenant of Mayors is a group of major European cities committed to cutting emissions 80% below the level of 1990 by 2050. The cities have set a target to increase energy efficiency by 30% and renewable energy by 50%. 

A key element of the Covenant of Mayors is a focus on sustainable transport. As part of the agreement, the cities have committed to purchase a minimum of 10 million 2022-2023 Euro 3 cars for cities, cities' fleets
The meeting between Meglena Kuneva, Commissioner for Internal Market and Services and Claude Moraes, member of the Committee on International Trade, gave an account of the importance of including environmental and social considerations in the EU's trade policy. It was noted that the inclusion of sustainability provisions focusing on labour and environmental standards in EU's bilateral trade agreements is an example of this, which the Commission is pushing for in new agreements to be negotiated.
A second point was made about increasing trade between and among developing
The MEP (Meglena Kuneva) reassures that the Commission is taking the matter up with Canadian authorities at the highest level and will be calling for the revision of Canadian copyright law to be initiated as soon as possible and preferably during the Parliament's present session.
Given the urgency of the situation, the Commission is doing everything it can to ensure that Canada amends its relevant legislation without further delay. The Commission is also concerned with the implications of Canada's proposed reform of its Copyright Act
- EU and US negotiating to a negotiated solution on hormone-treated beef
- EU and US authorities agreed to hold further talks to find a negotiated solution
- Negotiations are ongoing and the Commission is optimistic a negotiated solution can be found
- EU and US officials agreed to a two week delay on the imposition of 'Carousel' sanctions
Commissioner Kuneva would be happy to convey the message to Commissioner Ashton and will surely deliver a satisfactory response.  The Commission will take into account the Swedish court's ruling on the non-compliance of Regulation No. 261/2004 by airlines, while enforcing the regulation.  The Commission will definitely hold another meeting with the airlines to discuss this issue.
The case of Olympic Airways will be examined, but the Commission is not opposed to the privatisation of other European airlines facing similar problems.
-  Antonio Tajani, Vice-President of the European Commission, replied to Emmanouil Angelakas, stressing the EU's favourable opinion on the sale of Olympic Airlines and Olympic Airways Services businesses.
-  The EU's decision to sell Olympic Airlines and Olympic Airways Services businesses stimulated the creation of a new airline model, what ought to be the airline of the future: no more state companies but fully privatised companies.
-  The EU is in favour of

2.	Most of the 831 km stretch between Strasbourg and Vienna will be complete by 2015.

- The German Government is currently conducting a review of its multiannual programming, and so we will have to wait until the end of this year before we can begin discussing this very important section.
- The Strasbourg-Vienna section will cost EUR 10 billion and the priority project will cost EUR 13.5 billion in total.
- I believe that this information may be of use and covers all of the requests made in Mr Posselt
