SUMMARY
- There is an error in the voting list of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
- In the final vote on both the amended proposal and the legislative resolution, it should say 'free votes'.
- This is an abuse of parliamentary independence of individual Members.
