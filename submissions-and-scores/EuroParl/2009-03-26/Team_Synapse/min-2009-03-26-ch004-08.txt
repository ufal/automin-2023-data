SUMMARY
- PERSON077 asks for the final vote on the resolution and the report on Turkmenistan to be postponed until the next plenary sitting.
- The majority in Parliament would be able to agree to the signing of the interim agreement, even if it pains them to do so, but they need guarantees from the Commission and the Council that the human rights situation will be monitored and if it worsens serious consideration will be given to suspending the agreement.
