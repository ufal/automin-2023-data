I would like to thank Mrs Fajon for her excellent report and for her commitment to the cause of visa liberalisation.

- The European Parliament supports the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans
- The citizens of the Western Balkans have been isolated by the visa regime for far too long
- The abolition of visas will make an enormous contribution to the process of regional cooperation and the overcoming of ethnic divisions
- The Commission's proposal for the abolition of the visa requirement for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro is welcomed
- The European Union has a political responsibility to finalise the process of visa liberalisation
- The Council Presidency was invited, but had scheduling problems and so is unable to be here
- The Commission will monitor closely the fulfilment, by all of the countries concerned, of all the criteria laid down in the road map
- Parliament and the Council will support the abolition of the visa requirement for all the countries of the Western Balkans
- The Commission will prepare a proposal that the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania be abolished as soon as they have met the relevant criteria
- The summer of 2010 is a realistic date for the abolition of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania
