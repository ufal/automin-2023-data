Meeting KeyPoints:

1. The EU should fully implement its commitments on gender equality in EU foreign policy by speeding up its work on an EU action plan on gender equality. 
2. Close examination of the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in EU external relations reveals that women are still underrepresented in high-level posts. 
3. A EU special representative for women's rights is still missing, despite the need for such an official position.
