(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the Haug report is a very important document. It is the first step in the process of preparing the 2009 budget.
<P>
The report highlights the fact that the EU budget is very small in comparison with the US budget, and that the Commission is proposing to allocate only 0.1% of GDP to combat climate change, whereas the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Stern report, the UNDP and the World Bank are all telling us that we should be mobilising between 0.6 and 1.6% of GDP.

- Commission proposes to allocate 0.1% of GDP to combat climate change
- UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Stern report, UNDP and World Bank recommend mobilizing between 0.6 and 1.6% of GDP
- Commission's Global Climate Change Alliance has EUR 20 million a year for three years
- Gap between needs and resources provided is massive
- Council not willing to budge on expenditure
- Commission has right of initiative, but not using it
- Margin of at least EUR 2 billion available
- Council proposed to reduce funds to implement the common agricultural policy and transfer them to finance other tasks
- Ireland's rejection of EU draft constitution has an unpredicted impact on the draft budget for 2009
- Gap gradually opening up between long-term budget forecast and budget reality
- Member States' governments not drawing on budgetary resources sufficiently dynamically
- Tendency towards a mid-year increase in payments reducing in relation to gross national product and absolute mid-year terms
- Relative and absolute fall in expenditure on competition and cohesion policy
- Gap between lofty aims and available funds
