(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Haug for her excellent report.
<P>
I would like to draw attention to the fact that the budget for 2009 is a budget for the future. It is a budget for the future of Europe, for the future of the European Union, and for the future of the citizens of the European Union.
<P>
We must ensure that the budget is used to promote the European Union's political priorities, and that it is used to promote the European Union's economic and social objectives.
<P>
We must ensure that the budget is used to promote the European Union's external relations, and that it is used to promote the European Union's security and defence objectives.
<P>
We must ensure that the budget is used to promote the European Union's environmental objectives, and that it is used to promote the European Union's research and development objectives.
<P>
We must ensure that the budget is used to promote the European Union's cultural objectives, and that it is used to promote the European Union's social objectives.

• EU budget is not equal to the EU's needs and ambitions
• Does not reflect the EU's political priorities
• Increase in the very low level of payment appropriations
• Funds allocated from the budget to combat pressing problems (energy policy, climate change, food supply) are very low
• Low percentage of payment appropriations (0.9% of GNI)
• Funds mentioned under heading 4 (EU as a Global Player) are just 1.8% higher than in 2008
• Mandate should be set in relation to what citizens expect of the budget
• Focus on four issues: high prices, climate change, competitiveness and the environment
• Special effort on Frontex and immigration
