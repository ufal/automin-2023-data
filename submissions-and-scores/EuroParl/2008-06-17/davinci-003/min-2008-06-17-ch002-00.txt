- Summarize the meeting:

1. The European Parliament has endorsed the establishment of a contact-point network against corruption.
2. The purpose of the network is to foster cooperation among the authorities and agencies in the Member States and to encourage the exchange of data on effective strategies.
3. The Council proposal is too lacking in ambition and is toothless and thus redundant as it stands.
4. Parliament has tabled a number of amendments, including that OLAF, Europol and Eurojust should be mandatory participants, the network should submit an annual report to the European Parliament, and the costs of all of the network members should be borne from the Community budget.
5. Hubert Pirker urges the Council to incorporate Parliament's proposals and establish the contact-point network swiftly.
