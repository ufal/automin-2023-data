Meeting KeyPoints:

- The eighth directive on statutory audits of annual accounts has been implemented in 27 countries; however, key definitions are framed differently in different countries and the number of Member States that have independent public oversight is a long way short of 27. The report calls on the Commission to take steps quickly to correct these deficiencies.
- The method of harmonisation employed, namely minimum harmonisation, is not the right way to attain uniform application
- The Commission will inform Parliament at the appropriate time of the measures taken by the Member States in the wake of the Commission's recommendation on limiting the civil liability of auditors
- The item will be closed.
