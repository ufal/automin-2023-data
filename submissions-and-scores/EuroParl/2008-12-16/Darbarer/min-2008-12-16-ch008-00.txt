🔷 Attitude towards democracy
	📅 Nigel Farage and Martin Schulz had a debate about the European Union's attitude towards democracy this morning
	🔹 Nigel Farage made disparaging and derogatory comments about the leader of the Socialist Group in June this year, but he was allowed by the President to get up and say that his comments had been untrue and that he had never suggested that the 'no' side could be linked with fascism in the future.
