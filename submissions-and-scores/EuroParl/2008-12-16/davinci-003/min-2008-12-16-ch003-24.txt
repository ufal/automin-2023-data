- The Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 20 November 2008 drew up a draft agenda for the part-session.
- The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed postponing the voting on the report by Mrs De Keyser on the participation of the State of Israel in Community programmes and the voting on the motions for a resolution regarding the same topic.
- This request was based on the fact that an official delegation from the Parliament visited Israel and the Palestinian territories in May and unanimously adopted a statement calling for 'serious signs of good faith translated into tangible improvements on the ground' before upgrading EU-Israel relations.
- Daniel Cohn-Bendit argued that it would be disastrous to vote either in favour or against the recommendation made by the Council, and proposed postponing the vote until there is evidence of these signs in Israel's policy and on the ground.
- José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra stated that the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted overwhelmingly in favour of Mrs de Keyser's report, and proposed that the European Parliament take a firm stand for peace in the Middle East and give its assent to the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation with Israel.
