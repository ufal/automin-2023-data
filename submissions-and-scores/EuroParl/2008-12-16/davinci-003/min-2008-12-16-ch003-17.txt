- An oral amendment to recital B was proposed by Charles Tannock, which was accepted by the majority of the members
- The amendment added the wording 'on disputed ownership' to the recital
- Marios Matsakis proposed an oral amendment to the amendment, which was not accepted by the author
- A vote was taken on recital B, as amended by Tannock, and it was accepted
- An oral amendment to recital D was proposed by Charles Tannock, which was accepted by the majority of the members
- The amendment added the wording 'may pave' to the recital
- Marios Matsakis opposed the amendment, but a vote was taken and it was accepted
