SUMMARY
- There was a motion for a resolution for today on China, on the case of Mr Gao Zhisheng, a well-known lawyer who is under arrest and there are fears that he will be tortured.
- The motion could not be moved in the March II session, because there are two plenary sessions in the same month.
- The President should express his concern about the case to the Chinese embassy.
