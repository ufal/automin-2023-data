- The meeting discussed the recast procedure and its implications on the Krahmer report and the Cashman report.
- Graham Watson, on behalf of the ALDE Group, requested a delay in the vote to study the implications of the recast procedure.
- Guido Sacconi supported the proposal to delay the vote but pointed out that the problem would not have arisen if certain amendments had not been tabled.
- Caroline Jackson opposed moving the vote, arguing that it would be more sensible to vote now rather than add it to the list of votes for the following day.
- Holger Krahmer, the rapporteur, saw no reason to postpone the vote and argued that the recast rules had been applied consistently in committee and should be applied consistently in plenary.
