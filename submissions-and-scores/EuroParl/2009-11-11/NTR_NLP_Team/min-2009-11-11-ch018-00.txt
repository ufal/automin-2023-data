Meeting KeyPoints:

The Council confirmed its intention to adopt conclusions on the issue during the Competitiveness Council on 3 December. The resolution supports the EU's move towards more coordinated research and innovation work to combat neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.
The resolution also underlines the importance of research and innovation cooperation, which should foster the development of effective prevention, diagnoses, treatments and care for people suffering from these diseases.
Next, the Council reaffirmed its opinion that future initiatives to set joint research activities should
The Swedish Presidency believes that the Council should adopt conclusions on this joint programming initiative on the basis of the text that has been tabled by the Commission.  The Presidency will try to ensure that Parliament's views are, as far as possible, incorporated into the conclusions that are to be adopted when the Competitiveness Council meets on December 3, 2019.  As regards possible future joint programming initiatives, the Council shares the Member's view that a common approach should be chosen to adopt these initiatives under
- Increasing life expectancy has created new challenges relating to quality of life for those with neurodegenerative diseases
- Promoting scientific research in this field will enable us to combat the scourge of neurodegenerative diseases
- Ensuring that the results of future research are effectively put into practice will be vital to improving the current situation
- Parliament must be involved and its position taken into account in future joint programming for research activities
- A more certain legal basis will be needed in the future to ensure full parliamentary involvement
Here is a quick extract of what was said at the meeting:

Jorgo Chatzimarkakis raised the need for joint research to diagnose and treat neurodegenerative diseases, with the hope that it could become a directive.
The long-term costs are set to soar, and there is still a lot of research to do.  There is a lot of duplicated research and bureaucracy in Europe.
We also tabled a motion for research results to be made publicly available.  Unfortunately
- There is a need to have a balance between prevention, understanding why diseases happen and what the factors are to really prevent it effectively
- Taking money from ITER, which the best scientists say will pay off in 60 years, to fund research into Alzheimer's disease and other diseases of a similar nature is necessary
- The fundamental issue is joint programming of research
- The decision to prioritise research
They, their families and their carers will welcome a proactive approach to tackling this disease, which can be so devastating to both sufferers and families. Alzheimer's disease is one such neurodegenerative disease, which can be so devastating to both sufferers and families. It is in areas like this that I believe it is good to see cooperation across European states. I believe that a coordinated approach to tackling disease can bring forward new evidence, new medical breakthroughs and, in time, improve treatment and cure
The Joint Programming of Research is a valuable tool for reducing fragmentation by involving, at European level, the Member States, the public sector and the private sector. 
However, I am concerned about the implementation of this joint programming tool in terms of bureaucratic complexity and delays in administrative procedures. I would therefore like to ask what the plans are for using a process based on economy of scale, combining efficiency, simplification and fast-tracking of administrative procedures so as to promote excellence and to encourage collaboration at
- The issue of disease-fighting and research priority is of utmost importance and needs to be addressed by the EU institutions
- There is a need to research causes and find treatments, as well as find a cure for the patients and their families suffering
-  The research efforts should be coordinated between the EU Member States with the aim of creating public awareness
- The EU should create a database to gather data and find a cure, and ownership of the database should rest with the public
-
I welcome the proposal for a recommendation of the Commission on joint programming of research in the area of neurodegenerative diseases.

Diseases of this type are affecting an ever-increasing number of people in the EU.

This is why efforts are required to combat the factors responsible for triggering these diseases.

However, in order to combat these factors, they need to be identified through research.
The joint programming of research activities (jpra) pilot project in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease in particular, provides an optimistic analysis of the expected benefits of cooperation in research among Member States and of the coordination that the Commission can carry out, in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme, with regard to neurodegenerative diseases.
The measures proposed in the communication only concern the principle of making better use of existing resources and programmes: the 'Health' Programme, the Seventh Framework Programme
1.	The Commission should consider using Article 182 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as a legal basis for future joint programming initiatives in the field of research.
2.	There is an urgent need to coordinate and pool the data from the research of private and public organisations in the EU and Member States in order to develop new ways of dealing with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
3.	The fight against these diseases needs to be complemented with practical
Parliament emphasized the importance of four issues in the meeting: research developments, early diagnosis, improved quality of life for patients and their carers, and the status of Alzheimer's associations.

The programme is urgent, and the Commission needs to get started on the action that Parliament asked it to take. The Commission will examine the four issues raised by Parliament in a timely manner. 

The planned pilot project in this area is an ideal starting point for better interlinking current research efforts.
