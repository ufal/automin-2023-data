Meeting KeyPoints:

The Services Directive will unleash the power of the single market in a sector that comprises probably 70% of the European economy and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. It is complicated in many areas and has needed a lot of attention from the European institutions. The transposition of this, in a consistent and full way, is absolutely vital for its effective operation. Unless all colleagues move together to do this, and all countries move together to do this, that discrimination is going to remain and that is why
- The mutual evaluation process which is a new one is going to be vital in removing obstacles to trade between countries
- The Commission is planning to approach this process with support from the Council
- Members States will have to provide a list of regulations and internal statutes that they want to retain which
The service sector in the EU has been complaining about administrative burdens for years. By implementing the Services Directive, the EU is taking a major step to improve the situation.
First, the free movement of services has to work as intended. To address the issue, the Services Directive was put into effect in 2018. The directive sets common standards for 5 areas:
- The provision of services (except for telecom)
- Transparency of the regime
- Information for consumers
- Registration
The most important challenges related to the implementation of the Services Directive in time include establishing the points of single contact and ensuring that they operate smoothly, ensuring the proper governance of the Directive and setting up the necessary structures. Regarding the involvement of interested stakeholders, many stakeholders were involved during the negotiation period of the Directive, including social partners, consumer organisations, business enterprises, and many others.
The meeting transcript has provided a concise summary of the key events leading to the adoption of the Services Directive and its current state. 

While the meeting transcript doesn't mention it, the European Commission made a significant effort to facilitate the process of transposing the Services Directive. More than 80 bilateral meetings with all member states, as well as expert groups meetings in Brussels, were held during the last three years. 

Almost half of the member states are able to transpose the Services Directive
- The transposition deadline has not yet expired and Member States have not yet submitted their legislative changes to the Commission. But it is clear that an ambitious and thorough process of screening is crucial to ensure the 'internal market friendliness' of national legislation in each and every Member State.
- The implementation of the directive in the area of social services does not seem to have raised particular problems, as the directive itself contains
1/ The directive in question, which started off as a Parliament initiative, has not yet been transposed by the end of 2016. 
2/ As the directive is important for the internal market and consumer rights, the Council asks the Parliament to proceed with a screening of the Member States' transposition records, with a view to ensuring that all Member States transpose the directive by the end
First, regarding the calendar:
Creutzmann responds that the Services Directive is indeed entering into force on December 31, 2017, and that there are
The services directive is one of the most important pieces of legislation in the EU as it will give businesses and citizens more freedom to choose where to work and live.  A major challenge is how to effectively transpose this into all member states by the end of 2009.  The committee discussed several concerns, one of them being how to equip single points of contact with the right language skills and adequate technical resources in order to deal with all incoming concerns.  There is currently no evidence that this would significantly reduce
First, Svensson expressed the Socialist Party's point of view at the time of the Services Directive's adoption. 
Second, she expressed the view that the Services Directive should be understood as the end of a journey for Europe, which consists in making the internal market a fully-functional area for trade.
Third, she disagreed with the Council's interpretation of the Vaxholm ruling, and stated that Swedish labour law must take precedence over European law. 

Fourth, Comi
Following the adoption of the Services Directive, the European Union has a deadline of 28 December 2009 to transpose it correctly into national laws of the EU Member States. As the Minister for Internal Market and Services, Róża, Gräfin von Thun Und Hohenstein, pointed out, the lack of proper implementation of the Services Directive undermines the very basis of the social model of the European Union, namely the integration of services of general interest. The question that Róż
Therefore, in the report concerning the table of results for the internal market, I propose the initiative of organising a forum for the internal market, which would bring together representatives of European institutions, Member States and other interested groups with the aim of achieving a more explicit commitment to transposition, so that we will be able to apply and execute legislation on the internal market, including this extremely important directive. I would like the forum to be a place for the exchange of experience of Member States and EU institutions in
The agreement on the directive will limit its effects to those countries which have transposed it correctly and provided for a monitoring mechanism. The local bakers association is not part of this agreement. 
Małgorzata Handzlik from the Polish government noted that her country is the only one that has not transposed the directive in a proper way. The implementation process is ongoing and she hopes it will be completed in January 2019.

Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL, PT): Mr President, Commissioner, the internal market and the Services Directive must not be allowed to cause more damage to the most vulnerable social groups in the European Union. That is why we must not wait for the results of the impact assessment to begin again imposing necessary protective measures. I therefore call on the Council to reject the amended proposal put forward by the Commission. 
Seán Kelly (GA)Mr President, I also
