• The Services Directive is one of the most important initiatives adopted in recent years, with great potential to remove barriers to trade in the internal market and modernize public administrations
• The European Parliament has played a key role in making its adoption possible and has shown continued interest in monitoring the work done by the Member States to implement the directive
• The Commission has delivered on its commitment to facilitate the implementation process, with over 80 bilateral meetings with all the Member States and expert groups meeting in Brussels over 30 times during the last three years
• Just over half of Member States seem to be in a position to achieve the implementation of the Services Directive by the end of 2009 deadline or in the beginning of 2010
• Member States have completed the process of 'screening' their national legislation, but the extent to which the screening has contributed to an effective transposition of the directive is difficult to assess
• Most Member States will have basic, practical, point-of-single-contact solutions in place by the end of 2009
• Stakeholders have played a vital role throughout the implementation process and will be consulted next year during the evaluation of the results of the implementation
