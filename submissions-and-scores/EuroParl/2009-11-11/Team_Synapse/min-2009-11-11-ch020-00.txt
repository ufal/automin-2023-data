SUMMARY
- Tanja Fajon's report is on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement.
- The European Parliament supports the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans.
- The citizens of these countries have fewer rights today, as regards free travel, than they did in the days of the former Yugoslavia.
- The abolition of visas will make an enormous contribution to the process of regional cooperation and the overcoming of ethnic divisions.
- Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania need to be prepared for visa abolition.
- The Swedish Presidency was not invited to tonight's meeting.
- Tanja Fajon, the rapporteur, reminds the House that the Swedish Presidency has supported the process of visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans from the very beginning.
- The Commission supports the text of the joint political declaration.
- Bosnia and Albania have not yet been able to complete the necessary reforms requested in the road map to justify the exemption of the visa requirement.
- Serbia and Montenegro hosted missions led by the Commission, in association with experts from the Member States, and those missions confirmed that all of the criteria of the respective road maps had been fulfilled properly.
- The PPE Group is committed to visa liberalisation for all Western Balkan countries by July 2010.
- It took three months of negotiations for the PPE group to convince the political left in this House to operate according to the treaties.
- The European Parliament is not above the law and is not here to score points.
- Visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans is a humanitarian act.
- People from Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Montenegro will be able to travel freely again.
- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo cannot yet join them, but in December, the Commission will acknowledge the progress made by Albania and Bosnia.
- Tomorrow the European Parliament will vote on abolishing the short-stay visa requirement for Balkan countries.
- Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are not eligible for the visa waiver.
- Macedonia has been separated from the European Union for almost 12 years.
- Macedonia's free travel in the EU amounts to a step towards fully-fledged membership.
- On the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the proposal to guarantee the crossing of borders in Western Balkan countries is welcomed.
- The issue of providing visa-free travel is only partially a technical one and a political matter at the same time.
- People from the Western Balkans will be able to move freely around the European Union.
- PERSON250 congratulates rapporteur and shadow rapporteur for drafting an acceptable compromise on visa liberalisation for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Kosovo.
- Hungarian MEP congratulates the Joint Declaration and report.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote is tomorrow at 11.00.
