5. Welcome

On behalf of Parliament, The President welcomed members of a delegation
from the Knesset, led by Amira Dotan, who had taken their seats in the
distinguished visitors' gallery.



                                      
                                      

The following spoke: Sarah Ludford, who, in reference to an e-mail sent by
the Secretary-General on Tuesday 23.09.2008 concerning the resumption of
Parliament's activities in Strasbourg as of the October II part-session,
asked on what basis this decision had been taken (the President replied
that an announcement would be made to all Members), and Alexander Alvaro,
who complained that the poster calling for support for Written Declaration
0075/2008 on holding all European Parliament plenary sessions in Brussels
had been removed without the consent of the declaration's authors (the
President took note).
