- On 26 September 2008, the European Union and the European Council are supporting a series of initiatives to promote the valuation of languages and cultures and to highlight the importance of learning languages.
- The linguistic diversity of Europe is an essential element of our intellectual heritage and is one of our cultural treasures.
- Multilingualism and promoting linguistic diversity are cornerstones of our day-to-day activities in the European Parliament.
- Translation and interpreting of our work as representatives of the peoples of Europe play a vital part in ensuring its legitimacy and transparency and bringing our Parliament ever closer to European citizens.
- The European Parliament is the only international organisation which has a website and web television in 23 different languages.
- A European Union that is united in diversity need have no concerns about its future.
- The building in Strasbourg is every bit as safe as the building in Brussels.
