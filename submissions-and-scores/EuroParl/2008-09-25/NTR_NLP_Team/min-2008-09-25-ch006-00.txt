Meeting KeyPoints:

Thank you for your attention, Ladies and Gentlemen. I have a point of order. If you have the information to tell us that it is safe to go back to Strasbourg, why can you not make a statement now before we leave this plenary and risk going back to a building that some of us think is still unsafe? President: Mrs Lynne, all the information given to me indicates that the building in Strasbourg is every bit as safe as this building here in Brussels.
