Meeting KeyPoints:

We have one key point, which is the question of voting rights for migrants in the European Union, not because we reject enfranchisement in general but because we take the view that subsidiarity should apply to such decisions. Electoral law is not a European matter. For this reason, we would like to build a bridge to the amendment by proposing that it be reworded. We ask our fellow Members in the other groups to support the new wording so that we can all approve this
