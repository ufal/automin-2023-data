Meeting KeyPoints:

Yes, I support the request to postpone the vote on this resolution.  Given the current crisis in the financial markets, the governance of accounting standards and their potentially procyclical nature is a major issue.  By bringing forward this resolution for a vote during the next mini-plenary, we can give the European Parliament an opportunity to engage constructively with the Commission on this important topic.
