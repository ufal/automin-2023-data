- Manfred Weber, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, proposed an oral amendment for the reformulation of Amendment 1.
- Weber praised the report from Mr. Deprez and the entire committee, stating that the PPE-DE Group would like to vote in favor of it.
- The key point of contention was voting rights for migrants in the European Union.
- Weber argued that electoral law is not a European matter and that subsidiarity should apply to such decisions.
- The proposed new wording aimed to integrate long-term residents into political life at the European and local level, but the oral amendment was not adopted.
