Meeting KeyPoints:

Thank you Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I have three seconds. 

I would like to thank the colleagues involved, above all Commissioner Piebalgs, because he truly has worked to help us achieve a good compromise and overcome differences, and also thanks to my friends and fellow Members for their support throughout the work on this directive, and last but not least, I would like to thank the Italian presidency for its cooperation.
