- Summarize:

- The Commission thanked Mr Duff for his report and supported Parliament's decision to reform the hearing procedure.
- The procedures to be applied must respect the relevant provisions of the Treaties and the Framework Agreement.
- Procedures for portfolio reshuffles should be lighter than those for approving the whole Commission.
- The Commission reserves the right to agree the relevant procedures to be applied in each of the different scenarios on a case-by-case basis.
- This approach has proved successful for both institutions.
