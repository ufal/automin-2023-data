SUMMARY
- The European Parliament is being asked to adopt four comitology reports on the multiannual programmes in the field of culture, education, youth and citizen participation in community activities.
- The Committee on Culture and Education points out that the decisions on the choice and funding of the different activities covered by these programmes should rely on clear and objective criteria.
- The fact that the proposals have been accepted by both the Commission and the Council is satisfying.
