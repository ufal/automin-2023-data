- The fight against stereotypes is a priority in the Equality Roadmap for 2006-2010.
- Stereotypes create barriers for women in various aspects of life, such as job hunting, career progression, and work-life balance.
- Coordinated action and campaigns against stereotypes are needed, including social consciousness, education, and proper practices.
- Marketing and advertisements in the media play a significant role in forming the image of women, and can either maintain or challenge stereotypes.
- Existing legislation must be applied appropriately to combat gender discrimination and promote positive change.
