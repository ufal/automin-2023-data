Meeting KeyPoints:

Following the annual work meeting of the European Parliament, a brief extract from the meeting transcript is provided below:

Eva-Britt Svensson: Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and especially the shadow rapporteur for excellent and constructive contributions to the report. The Presidency of the Council has highlighted the importance of combating gender stereotypes. This is one of the six priority areas of the Presidency. Therefore I consider
The report by Mariya Svensson and Mariya comparison regulated advertising their in the media but also encouraged further controls on advertising from the subjective area of gender politics.
As Media Commissioner, I recognise the underlying policy concerns, but I also wonder what will be the impact of these concerns if they are carried out on a whole industry and on the general public. Advertising is a soft target because it is much easier to regulate it than to address the underlying problems, which are often more complex. As
- There are legislative measures to solve the problems related to gender inequality in advertising
- There is no conclusive research that links stereotyping with gender inequality in advertising
- Policy-making requires a strong evidence base, not just strongly held views
- Best-practice exchange, for instance, among the regulators is something that we encourage
- Education, research and further debates should certainly continue
- I would
In the European People's Party we believe in equality between men and women, but we believe it must be advocated without giving anyone else a bad name.  We believe that childhood and youth must be protected and that children and young people must be brought up by their families and society as a whole.  Brought up with values which help them to be better people.  I believe that the sectarian use of equality, which is the aim of this report, is a serious mistake and the EPP
- There are other kinds of families on earth which are not shown in advertising
- There are still advertisements for products which respect freedom of expression
- There is still room for freedom of expression when it comes to advertising sexual services
- Some think that at least one woman should be appointed to one of the top four posts in the European Union
Based on today's hearing, it seems clear that the Commission shares the same goal as the EFDD group: to protect Advertising aimed at Children from indecent content.
Following a discussion on the implications of  advertising for equality, both positives and negatives, the EU intends to establish that equality in every area of activity. 
It is unthinkable that the realm of advertising should be excluded. 
The EU welcomes the report by Mrs Svensson who has addressed this important issue and presented a balanced report. 
You have my sincere thanks. 
Advertising affects us subconsciously. 
One major effect is the way it
The President and Commissioners outlined the challenges that remain in combating gender stereotypes in advertising. Despite these challenges, they were encouraged by the results achieved so far and the potential for more progress.
Marketing and advertising should create an environment for social understanding, for social prospects. Advertisers should refute the stereotypes surrounding women and men and encourage a culture of equality. Advertisers should spread the principles of gender equality through media programming. Advertisers should popularize good practices of respect and appreciation
- Advertising has an indisputable effect on the public's behaviour and the formation of public opinion
- Advertising the sale of sexual services and prostitution corrupts children from a tender age
- It is difficult at the European level for us to interfere with media freedom and not adhere to the principle of subsidiarity
- My view is that the main responsibility lies with parents and teachers
- Negative stereotyping needs to be mentioned, and gender inequality is a major element in bad advertising
-
- Since we are discussing a field falling under Community competence, namely trade in audiovisual services, I believe fines to be enforced by the European Commission to producers promoting discriminatory imagines through publicity should be introduced.
- Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou: Mr President, we are in favour of both the market economy and competitiveness.
- On the basis, then, of healthy competition, we want the truth to
- A matter of principle - stereotypes create a scandalous situation for women and form a significant barrier to their success - whether it be in their job-hunting, their workplace, their career progression, their participation in decision-making or in balancing their work and private life.
- Coordinated action and campaigns against stereotypes are needed -  it is important that the social consciousness that starts in childhood, education and the application of proper practices.
- The marketing and advertisements that appear in the media have
