- The main purpose of the Corbett report is to prevent Members who share a belief in the defense of national identity, sovereignty, and independence from being able to form a group.
- The report might result in a large number of non-attached Members who, having discovered their common ground, decide to form a group that would be politically incorrect but would have even more Members.
- The report was voted against in its original form in committee, and the amended version now before the House bears little resemblance to the original one.
- The number of Members of Parliament has grown from 626 to 785 following the major enlargement and is now set to rise from 732 to 751.
- The minimum size of a political group needs to be redefined due to the changes in the number of Members of Parliament.
