SUMMARY
- The European Parliament has wished for many years to express its views on small and medium-sized enterprises, which represent 99% of all European companies and 75 million jobs.
- Today only 3% of SMEs access the foreign, external market and only 8% access the internal market.
- The Parliament asks the Council and the Commission to take account of these facts in multilateral and bilateral negotiations.
