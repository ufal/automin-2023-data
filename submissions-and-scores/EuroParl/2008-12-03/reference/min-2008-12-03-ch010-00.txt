10. Order of business

The next item was the order of business.
The final draft agenda for the December I sittings (PE 416.044/PDOJ) had
been distributed and a number of changes had been proposed (Rule 132):

Wednesday

Request by the GUE/NGL Group to hold over to a later date the vote on the
De Keyser report on Israel's participation in Community programmes (A6-
0436/2008) (Item 9 of the final draft agenda) and the vote on the motions
for resolutions tabled to wind up the debate on this subject (Item 10 of
the final draft agenda)

The following spoke: Francis Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, who
moved the request, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,
and Jos Ignacio Salafranca Snchez-Neyra, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.

Parliament agreed to the request by electronic vote (194 in favour, 173
against, 10 abstentions).

Thursday

The order of business was thus established.
