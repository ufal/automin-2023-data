Hey everyone, just a quick update to share the go-live dates for our remote work efforts. We expect to launch Monday, October 16th, 2018 and be fully remote on Tuesday, October 17th, 2018. 

As always,
ETA killed a businessman in Spain, and the European Union condemned the attack. Members stood and observed a moment of silence in memory of the people that died in India, and to remember the victims in Spain.
