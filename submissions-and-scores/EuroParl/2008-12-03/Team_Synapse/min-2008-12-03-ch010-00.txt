SUMMARY
- The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left proposes to postpone the vote on the report by Mrs De Keyser on the participation of the State of Israel in Community programmes and the voting on the motions for a resolution regarding the same topic.
- Last May, an official delegation from the European Parliament went to Israel and visited the Palestinian territories including Gaza.
- They unanimously adopted a statement that the time is not yet right to upgrade EU-Israel relations.
- Since then, no significant signs of good faith have been apparent.
