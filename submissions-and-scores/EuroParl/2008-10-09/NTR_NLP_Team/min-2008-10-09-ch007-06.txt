Meeting KeyPoints:

  - The agreement on trade in services (TTIP) between the EU and Ukraine is a purely economic agreement
  - Since the situation in Ukraine is quite serious, I would like to make a comment on this report
  - It is a purely economic report which needs a broader strategy - Euromed union - based in Lublin, Poland
  - We need to learn from the Georgia crisis and ensure that we do not wake up one day outside the political stage
