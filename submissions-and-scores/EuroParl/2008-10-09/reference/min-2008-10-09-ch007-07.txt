7 7.7. IASCF: Review of the constitution - Public Accountability and the
Composition of the IASB Proposals for Change (vote)

Motion for a resolution B6-0450/2008

(Simple majority)

(Voting record: 'Results of votes', Item 7)

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION

Adopted (P6_TA(2008)0469)

The following spoke on the vote:
- Elisa Ferreira, before the vote, who pointed out a mistake in the PSE
Group voting list;

- Piia-Noora Kauppi, who said that adoption of Amendment 2 would not lead
to Amendment 4 falling, and asked that the latter therefore also be put to
the vote (the President did not accede to this request as Pervenche Bers,
chair of the ECON Committee, distanced herself from Piia-Noora Kauppi's
proposal).
