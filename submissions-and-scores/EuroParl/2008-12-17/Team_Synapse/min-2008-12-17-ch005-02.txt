SUMMARY
- There was no plenary debate on ETS.
- Parliament is supposed to endorse the amendments to the Commission's proposal, but what they are deciding on today matches the Council paper one-to-one.
- With the ETS proposal in its current form, inconsistencies and ballooning costs will catch up with us.
- The subject of emissions trading is the most important industrial policy decision for years to come.
