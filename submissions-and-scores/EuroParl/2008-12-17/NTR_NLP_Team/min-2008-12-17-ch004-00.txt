Meeting KeyPoints:

The Quaero report on the Climate and Energy package should be voted on separately, as it is an individual report not voted on as a part of the package.  The representatives of the groups who participated in the debate should be sanctioned if they are not physically present for the response from the Commission and the Presidency.  All allocated group time should be subtracted from for those representatives who overrun their time.
