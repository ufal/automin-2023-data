Meeting KeyPoints:

-emission standards for new passenger cars must be more rigorous, including better nitrogen oxides emissions standards;
-the legislation to implement the EU's CO2 emissions trading scheme must be approved by parliaments, not mandated by summits of heads of state;
-the legislation must be approved by parliament because allowing parliaments to properly debate the legislation would be "otherwise exceptional";
-there should be no "climate ministers" sitting in the legislative body that is legislating on climate change policy
Thank you to Commissioner Dimas, Minister Borloo, the French delegation and particularly Ambassador Léglise-Costa for their work. I would like to thank the Committee staff and in particular, Virpi Koykkä and Miroslav Ouzký for their excellent collaboration. My sincere appreciation also goes to my fellow shadow rapporteurs and their staff for a cooperative and constructive approach.
