Meeting KeyPoints:

- I reject emphatically the outrageous insult made to Mrs Göncz by Mrs Morvai, a member of a neo-fascist party
Based on the slanderous statements made here by his colleague, Mr. Zoltán Balczó can dare call a political party fascist in this Chamber, simply because it does not agree with every aspect of the European Union's main thrust.  The European Parliament is not the place to air disagreements on political parties' policies; that's the role of national parliaments.  Mr. Balczó should be focusing on the statements he himself has made, which are indeed slander
