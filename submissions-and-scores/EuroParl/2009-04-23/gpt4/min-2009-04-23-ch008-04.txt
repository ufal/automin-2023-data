- Solvency II aims to create a modern framework for insurance supervision in the EU
- The framework will be official for the insurance industry and policyholders
- The group support regime has been deleted, which is seen as a missed opportunity for progress in group supervision
- Implementing measures need to be in place before October 2012 to give Member States and the industry time to prepare
- The Commission will facilitate the process and put the reforms into practice as soon as possible for the benefit of all parties involved
