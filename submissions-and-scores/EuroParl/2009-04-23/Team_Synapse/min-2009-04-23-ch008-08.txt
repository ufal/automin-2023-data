ATTENDEES : PERSON162, PERSON163, PERSON164


SUMMARY
- Amendment 80 to a recital falls if Amendment 37 is passed.
- The corresponding amendment to the article, Amendment 81, is not marked as falling when the corresponding article amendment, 55, is passed, so PERSON162 wants to vote on Amendment 80 as an addition to 37.
- PERSON163 thinks it's appropriate to hear the opinion of the rapporteur, Mr Crowley.
- PERSON164 thinks it should be taken separately.
