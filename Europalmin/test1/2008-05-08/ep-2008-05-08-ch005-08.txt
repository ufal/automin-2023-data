8. EU Election Observation Missions (
<P>
- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="128" NAME="Michael Gahler" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(DE) Madam President, in consultation with the two rapporteurs, I propose the following addition:
<P>
'Pays tribute to the participation of observers from third countries, such as Switzerland, Norway and Canada, in EU electoral observation missions'.
<P>
(DE) Those concerned had requested that, and I think this encourages them to take part again next time.
<P>
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
