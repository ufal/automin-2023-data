(PERSON1) So lets wait short while for a short while on because I hope that [PERSON13] would join. We'll create new the credential for simple end users
Just and provide me something which sounds reasonable for you. () actual infrastructure which will help us in managing with kind of ASR output multiplexing, at the moment unfortunately, it has to be done at client level. The thing is that the what I see in the log file from EB client is that these English ASR or English sound is being converted while a a to, one of the target languages. And then another line, which says the same English sound, converted to another machine translation output and so on. Because in my opinion the mediator should, should somehow find an economic solution, also in the ASR route of the path, but is actually that it is not being a specially 90 here, and here. But I want to show you that I updated the EB client this way. So what i will try is to well, again, keep pinging [ORGANIZATION3] for a for getting this running, and for like providing so many workers that the bugs wont be that severe for the whole system, but does anyone have any idea. So the client that would get the CTM output from the worker, and then send this CTM to  the different segmentation workers, more get the segmentation outputs already and send a text. And we have to wait for the segmenter to process it but in this this case <unintelligible> not at once, so it could work. Of the current situation is indeed a use this text communication, so that we would have modified the EB client. And then it would send it to the different machine translation of systems as like another EB client would do. It, its still meaningful output, three and four, yes, so it works. (PERSON1) So the summary is that if we are lucky and the workers work. And for he highest number that we saw it running with was six right? <unintelligible>
So I dont think we can manage <unintelligible> anything like that. (PERSON7) <unintelligible> tommorow on Wednesday that I will be around for the event. (PERSON9) Maybe the maybe this one English EU could be working. So this is this is in the Google document I'm curious what the setup should be so that we stream the uh, the slides. For instance, I am I am in the middle of pushing that the the very same file in some additional instructions on on cruise control. (PERSON1) Yeah, so when we we should test this, and to get the enging server running. (PERSON1) Yes, now but it is essentially the same thing that I've put in the a sample pr- sub streaming some time ago, right? But for example, the Spanish coming from the German translation or English translation. We have tested the solution several times, and we and the students. It is pretty been impossible to the debug problems in these environments. <laugh>
So actually the functionality is working but we strongly suggest to, select our preffered path at the beggining. And this is important especially selec- is important especially the selection of the English the spoken English. And if as far as we understood of course maybe I'm wrong, there will be three person speaking English the one in the round table, and th<unintelligible> with corrects. And the performer translation only of eternal tone of all the possible combinations. That we would want to have the English subtitles presented from the main round table, and the translations to go from the respeakers. (PERSON1) So it is totally out of of control, and its <unintelligible> so out of control for presentation platform the presentation platform will simply you display different. ASR workers or the multiplexing worker, and the the streaming off, stream of slides. So I think thats thats everything that we could have discussed. And the two, these two messages were actually just the continuation of each other, and they like kept kept repeating. In order to have subtitles of suitable lenght, and also to have to not too fest. Then these two logics may fight together will fight with each other. What I saw the the this morning that seemed like that indeed. (PERSON10) Actually, we can test it the solution without our <unintelligible>. I have connected one to nine, nine workers but only seven of them are taken here. (PERSON1) Yeah, so [PERSON9] should not rely on this, like the. (PERSON10) [PERSON11] says he has a problem connecting to the pexip. (PERSON1) Yeah, so [PERSON11] tried to connect the <unintelligible>, but he failed. And I think that at this point there is nothing else to discuss, I would like to thank [PERSON9] and everybody else who has been helping him a lot with the debugging and. Too bad,
<laugh>
and are you 
<laugh>
and are you and [PERSON12] available for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, like possibly all of the time because right now we have as you were not at the call, but you have observed during the mornin that the critical point now is all the workers, its the combination of the non multiplexing in the mediator, and the unreliability of of the workers that puts extreme like demand on the number of ASR workers that are available, and we need you to swiftly restarting them. (PERSON3) But its, I dont think the process can be easily automated. But I think it should be easy to wrap them in something, so that you forgot to launch it you will modify the launching script so that the launching script will emmit its process ID. It has all the, everything this worker but they are no session IDs. (PERSON1) So there is no ASR workers in this list or are they. So we we have the system that works okay this way, I would prefer to find <unintelligible> the workers not resetting this so much more, for the [PROJECT1]. We have this program also, regularly its starting and stopping sessions, several times a day. I would like to see, uh, how do you tell a dead worker from a working worker, because I really do not like the idea of you restarting all of them. I know that you have not developed it yourself probably probably will see on. <laugh>
(PERSON3) It probably works, if I can avoid it I will not. And then the log file already contains the docker ID in its file name. (PERSON10) The XML which is the data XML, there is stream ID, which I actually dont know what it is. But then the <unintelligible> session ID which is together for example stop <unintelligible>. There is also session ID which could be exactly the session ID we are talking about. So I guess that if you, 
<parallel_talk>
So there is definitely way in which we could if you launch anything simple on your side then we should be able to reach it. <unintelligible>
(PERSON1) So that this is what you have already open, you have open SSH port on the on that machine, I'll share my screen. But I'll I'll have to leave very soon, my kids are waiting for me already. <laugh>
(PERSON3) <unintelligible>
(PERSON1) <unintelligible> Listen. And it appears on the netcut which was listening to this port. So I'll have to run now, but please prepare, please modify worker so that they show session ID and so that you have a simple script which would be something like restart by session ID.sh and we will send you session ID and yu would only do this, and it would do the right thing, and if you accidentaly run this on the wrong machine, which does not have this sesion ID the worker for the session ID it will tell you: "Well, I do not have that worker, you need to run me on the other other machine."
