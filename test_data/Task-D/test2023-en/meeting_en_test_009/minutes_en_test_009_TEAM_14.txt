(PERSON6) hope that [PERSON13] would join.
[PERSON12], please tell us about the presentation platform, which now requires password
[PROJECT1] 2019 username and password.
We'll create new the credential for simple end users [PERSON6].
(PERSON5) is going to register also these credentials and just being [PERSON5].
[PERSON13], are [ORGANIZATION3] listening.
[PERSON9] launches all the target languages, the same for given the input stream the same ASR worker type is launched as many times as there is sort of target languages.
() actual infrastructure which will help us in managing with kind of ASR output multiplexing at the moment unfortunately, has to be done at client level.
[PERSON9], if (PERSON6) could just launch ten workers at the same time like underneath of each other.
When actually it runs the requests to the mediator ten times or whether the mediator receives a multi like a Multi Channel, or multi path request.
(PERSON5) is still not seeing the screen.
EB client is converting ASR or English sound to machine translation output.
Just one, then the nine different are feeded by mediator without sending At this point (PERSON6)'m not more sure and on neither these information.
[PERSON9] has shared the info lines.
[PERSON5] would like to see is that the beginning until English text would be actually done only once.
the participants of the meeting have also between communication protocols reason possibility to find a kind when is performed.
(PERSON6) killed it right here.
EB is just making EB more to the workers
(PERSON6)'m going to run it on one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten on one 30 second audio.
[PERSON12] is not giving lecture, but has said anything useful during this morning.
(PERSON6) is afraid that the participants the of meeting what participants of the meeting need to [PERSON6] is, because the machine translation workers seem working well right.
Last time when the participants the of meeting thinked about this what was batch mode and the participants of the meeting agreed that we.
Because the participants of the meeting send to whole text file at once.
The EB client would ship the audios to the mediator and get the segment output from the segmenter mediator.
Yes, and it seems that two of them, no four of them are received identical output, but (PERSON6) think its because there is dynamic output.
And for he highest number that the participants meeting saw it running with was six right?
At this point six German, oh six English.
[ORGANIZATION4] is always like, that those who have delivered their work in the best shape.
(PERSON5) is afraid that [PERSON12] is going on holiday.
[PERSON5], [ORGANIZATION3], and [SHOWDOWN] on the call now.
(PERSON5) is going to run six publishers.
[PERSON5]'s question is that the participants the meeting can make little platform running locally within sol Wired Network.
It means that the engine has to run within network, but maybe not necessarily the whole presentation platform right
[PERSON13] is talking to the microphone and not even (PERSON5) can hear them.
[ORGANIZATION1]: [PERSON5's notebook] and [PION9)'s desktop, [orGANIZATION2]:
(PERSON6) can run it on the local network.
(PERSON12) still do not see for sure what is preventing us now from testing it.
[ORGANIZATION2] presentation platform web page and URL should be something local like RMTP Cologne//192.168
