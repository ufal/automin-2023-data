(PERSON1) So lets wait short while for a short while on because I hope that [PERSON13] would join.(PERSON1) Yeah, so while we are waiting if [PERSON12] reacts actually.(PERSON10) Okay username and password the authentication fees has been reintroduced so that only people participating participating in the event are allowed <unintelligible> subtitles.(PERSON10)Well when I prepared the Admin User, they asked me to include the act sign, actually, I do not know mm.And you know [PERSON5] is around at the moment because he said that he restarted, the publishers and the they failed.So when [PERSON9] launches all the target languages, the same for the given the input stream the same ASR worker type is launched as many times as there is sort of the target languages.And thats putting stress on [ORGANIZATION3], because they need to provide so many workers and their have these bugs in workers so that they keep failing.How difficult is it in the platform in the mediator,to, to like follow the path and avoid duplicating work.() actual infrastructure which will help us in managing with kind of ASR output multiplexing, at the moment unfortunately, it has to be done at client level.(PERSON10) Fortunately, there is nothing in the protocol <unintelligible> will help us problems solution.(PERSON10) <unintelligible> take note and find better solution in the protocol after these events.Yes, I can, wait for a moment
(PERSON1) Yeah, so the thing is that the mediator.When it actually runs the requests to the mediator ten times, or whether the mediator receives a multi like a Multi Channel, or or multi path request.(PERSON1) Yeah, so [PERSON9] will probably disconnect for a while, or another machine.The thing is that the what I see in the log file from EB client is that these English ASR or English sound is being converted while a a to, one of the target languages.Just one, then the nine different <unintelligible> are feeded by mediator without sending <unintelligible>
At this point, I 'm not more more sure and on neither of these information.Because in my opinion the mediator should, should somehow find an economic solution, also in the ASR route of the path, but is actually that it is not being a specially 90 here, and here.(PERSON1) So if you if you open the screen, that [PERSON9] has shared.And there you will see that in four lines, and these info lines are going from English lecture [ORGANIZATION3] hybrid audio to English <unintelligible> English text to English published, and similarly for the for the other languages.(PERSON1) So what I would like to see is that the the beginning until English <unintelligible> text would be actually done only once.It should have publishing or in English, or send it to the machine translation into Czech and so on.So we dont need any clever optimization of the path of we would need to only like combine the common prefix 
(PERSON10) I understand, but at the moment that it is not meant to work in this way.We have also between communication protocols <unintelligible> reason possibility <unintelligible> to find a kind of when <unintelligible> is performed.Because actually the [ORGANIZATION2] <unintelligible> is not meant to work in <unintelligible>
(PERSON1) Um-hum, yeah, okay.So right now [PERSON9] has tried to launch those and it failed, because there is not enough, ASR workers <unintelligible> right?So this is just making the EB 
(PERSON10) Yes thank you.(PERSON1) more to <unintelligible> of the workers
(PERSON9) Yes, but and on this wide terminal we see how many, how many ASR workers are available at this moment, there are six, and I 'm going to run it on one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten on on one 30 second audio.(PERSON1)Yeah, so I'm afraid that we what we need to you is, because the the the machine translation workers seem working well, right.So what i will try is to well, again, keep pinging [ORGANIZATION3] for a for getting this running, and for like providing so many workers that the bugs wont be that severe for the whole system, but does anyone have any idea.So the client that would get the CTM output from the worker, and then send this CTM to  the different segmentation workers, more get the segmentation outputs already and send a text.The EB client would ship the audios to the mediator and get the segment output from the segmenter <unintelligible> mediator.And then it would send it to the different machine translation of systems as like another EB client would do.(PERSON9) So it run one one audio to six six ASR workers at once, one, two, three, four, five, six.At this point six German, oh six English.(PERSON1) So is there anyone who would be available for implementing the C code the EB client, modified to do the multiplexing internally.<laugh>
(PERSON2) I'm afraid that you have low availability because [PERSON12] is going on holiday.(PERSON7) <unintelligible> tommorow on Wednesday that I will be around for the event.(PERSON1) Ok, so you will be around on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday but not tommorow.(PERSON7) No, I'll be around Thursday, Friday.(PERSON7) And the, I'll be around in the evening <unintelligible> stuff need to do on Wednesday.Okay, so thats the ASR workers in the Google document, and hopefully we'll hear something from [ORGANIZATION3], then the empty workers I said that these good.(PERSON1) And could it be related to the new authentication that is in the presentation platform.So the credentials are there, read only or or well, <unintelligible> user view should be [PROJECT2] password <unintelligible> 2019 admin view is the <unintelligible>.My question is so that we can make little platform running locally within sol Wired Network.(PERSON1) So the participants notebooks will all be connected to the very same wired network, and we need the URL with RTMP protocol with the stream subtitles to work from for their notebooks.I can probably relate what she is saying
<laugh>
Oh, well, try with different microphone.So this is this is in the Google document I'm curious what the setup should be so that we stream the uh, the slides.Since I'm i guess on the event you are going to be, every machine is going to be connected to the same LAN, right?For instance, I am I am in the middle of pushing that the the very same file in some additional instructions on on cruise control.So that we take uh, just an access point, the router or actually a switch, and we connect the two machines to that thing with wires.The the [ORGANIZATION2] presentation platform web page, and URL should be something local like RMTP Cologne//192.168 and so on so.You are using the in your tests, you are using the real [ORGANIZATION2] presentation platform, and the subtitles are coming from the the Internet while the stream is only copied locally.(PERSON1) Yeah, so when we we should test this, and to get the enging server running.(PERSON6) Yes I'm expanding this extra write <unintelligible> file, so you can you can find it on on GitbHub.(PERSON1) Yes, now but it is essentially the same thing that I've put in the a sample pr- sub streaming some time ago, right?Me and [PERSON14] will probably arrive at some point on Wednesday.<laugh>
(PERSON10) Okay.Or I can share mine, so here in the,
(PERSON10) Okay, I have a office number, but I can share with you the [PERSON14] one.(PERSON1) So I have [PERSON14] one, this this is mine cellphone number, i just pasted it to to the chat.And stream just the one we select and not perform all the possible translation and filter just the output of the presentation platform because otherwise it will be really difficult to understand what is going to happen.And this is important especially selec- is important especially the selection of the English the spoken English.Because [PERSON9] has shared with us the scheme of the microphones <unintelligible> and so on.And if as far as we understood of course maybe I'm wrong, there will be three person speaking English the one in the round table, and th<unintelligible> with corrects.It will be impossible at the moment to descriminate which English is coming from which microphone at present platform level.The EB client, what fed to the input to this EB client that determines the English channel.So I agree with you that uh, we do not want to have to use different English different versions of English for different target languages, but I think that it is possible.Uh, uh, [PERSON9] can simply run the EB client twice, one of those who will have connect to the English presentation, using the the round table sound.(PERSON1) So it is totally out of of control, and its <unintelligible> so out of control for presentation platform the presentation platform will simply you display different.But it has no way to to see which the English is which it will simply anyone who connects as little as a worker providing English will be displayed there.(PERSON10) Yeah
(PERSON1) So this is the uh, thank you for the classification.But this is there is still one more topic related, and thats the that the delivering subtitles to interpreters booth, and uh, that is something which will need different English languages the like string, booth one booth two booth three.We have to prepare you know, the X1 configuration, X1 X2.We are going to check <unintelligible> each path and i think that they already manage the directs ASR output for English, Czech and.<other_noise>
(PERSON1) Sorry i cant hear you, there is there is some noise.(PERSON10) Yes, I will be travelling but also in [LOCATION2] is holiday
(PERSON1) Oh okay.So that I will provide you my support during my travel, of course having the when I will have the <unintelligible>, when I'm not flying, and [PERSON5] will not be there so actually we have two, arrive on Wednesday which if possible everything as much stable as possible.So X1 till X4 should work, [ORGANIZATION2] will add them this afternoon, critical things to fix today + tommorow as test streaming of slides and debug ASR workers and or create multiplexing and I'll call it client, because its actually a client for the mediator.The experience was very annoying, because it was like two different text messages interchanging, or a select appearing one after another in loop on in the subtitles field.So that, for example, the output ASR could be an updated hypothesis that your presentation platform would be popping into two parts and showing them one after another.(PERSON10) Lets say the worker who manage the publication on presentation platforms perform <unintelligible> of organisation based on configurable parameters.(PERSON1) Yeah, so could this logic actually be actually remove from the or or disabled, at the presentation platform, a so that the present- <unintelligible> will simply show uh, too long string if if it arrives.(PERSON10) Ah, okay, the um,
(PERSON1) I'm afraid that if if there is like a logic implemented in two separate the components.(PERSON1) So simply show, whatever you receive from the ASR output.So in the long term and now we still have the [ORGANIZATION4] team on onboard, in the long term I think that we want to have machine translation as immediate as possible, translating incomplete sentences as well.Should be delierig well again, we dont know where the logic should, but the segmentation worker should send the whole sentece- well, should send segments, which start at the beginning of the sentence and they should gradually become longer and longer as more ASR output is ready.And in that case, I still think its beer if the segmentation worker is the one who would be forcefully cutting the sentences, rather than the presentation platform, because then the presentation platform is stuck with like I have shown only something, and I need to show something of the rest the later on.And then I do not know what to show like its the, Oh, where is the the segmentation worker from the ASR does have access to the continuous stream, right?Here, everyone please open the Google Document and fill your availability for tomorrow.It didnt say that it didnt connect so we should have this check and Dutch,Hungarian, Polish and so on.(PERSON10) On the admin web, it says that all all not available at the moment.(PERSON1) So could there be some delay with the information about the availability of two workers, so that when you run.(PERSON1) Minus N.
(PERSON9) Yeah.(PERSON9) And 0.5
(PERSON1) So twice a second we are getting an update but [PERSON13], could there still an delay in the mediator in the admin interface?<other_noise>
(PERSON10) Sorry [PERSON1].(PERSON1) Well, [PERSON9] is concerned about empty workers not being used, while the they should be.(PERSON10) I think that probably the admin web is based on <unintelligible> there could be a delay.(PERSON1) The interface is simply slow so only only when you run something for longer period of time then the numbers would be correct.(PERSON1) Yeah, but he is on- he was there for a while.When you will switch to German or to Czech, <unintelligible> tell us because maybe you can see something which is not what you expect.(PERSON1) Sorry I didnt get the message, so you, the message was that your, you have English as the preferred source language.(PERSON10) We are going to configure te presenation platform, English as the top priority source language since we are running test with English, but please if you change the test, tell us so that we can put German as top priority and so on, because otherwise we'll not be published i- on the front end the subtitle.(PERSON1) Oh so the the subtitles will not be published at all even if there is no English available, right?(PERSON10) Well, there is some kind of, fallback mechanism but its still pretty match manual, lets check things together.So we expect to be translating or well to be translating mainly from English indeed, so if we happen to to use German or Czech as the source language we'll let you know.(PERSON1) Yeah, so [PERSON11] tried to connect the <unintelligible>, but he failed.And I think that at this point there is nothing else to discuss, I would like to thank [PERSON9] and everybody else who has been helping him a lot with the debugging and.I would also like to ask everybody to keep debugging this afternoon and and tomorrow so that we have the workers reliable, and, yeah.Okay, so thanks everybody and please keep trying full load because this is something that we have not suceeded at all, [PERSON13] please let us know as soon as the <unintelligible> or the segmentation within the subtitle presentation is gone so that we can see what it what it looks like.(PERSON1) Okay, yeah, so thanks a lot and we'll be in touch well during the afternoon and also tomorrow during the times that you have inicated, possibly making another pexip call but its not planned far now yet.Bye
(PERSON1) Thank you,[PERSON11]?Too bad,
<laugh>
and are you 
<laugh>
and are you and [PERSON12] available for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, like possibly all of the time because right now we have as you were not at the call, but you have observed during the mornin that the critical point now is all the workers, its the combination of the non multiplexing in the mediator, and the unreliability of of the workers that puts extreme like demand on the number of ASR workers that are available, and we need you to swiftly restarting them.I want to be there as much as possible and to restart the workers <unintelligible> as possible, but i can not guarantee that <unintelligible> here at every minute.(PERSON1) Yeah, soI've asked [PERSON12] in the slack today, maybe you can not see the message, but my idea was that maybe you could setup very simple CGI script or PHP script or whatever, so that we could ping fixed URL and tell it the session ID of a worker, ASR worker which is not functioning.And what you would do, in the script would be you would know which process ID this ses-
this ID corresponds to and you would kill the process and start a new process instead, so that we could initiate the restart of the worker.I dont how I can make some kind of website available for you over the internet I dont know map our workers to session IDs, <unintelligible> the workers know about the session ID, I guess they do but it might have this.When they start they emmit the session ID when they get it from the from the mediator, so all you would need to do would be to grab the logs for the given session ID and the workers would need to save their process ID when they are put processing the log.And to create a webpage that would be accesible for us, its it depends on your setup but in principle you could also run a very small webserver such as Python <unintelligible> or Parallel <unintelligible>
that was the thing, and that that has to run on the machine where the workers are, so that like it can kill them and the firewalls must not be in the way, but if we set it up or if you set it up on on high port then you hopefully to get the request from us.<unintelligible>
I have no experience in coding in any web server package, I'm looking at the logs right now and I dont see easily from the logs where were the session ID, no I dont think  we can do this.(PERSON1) Well, I understand it is difficult to uh, to debug it, like to fix the workers so that they dont get stuck.But I think it should be easy to wrap them in something, so that you forgot to launch it you will modify the launching script so that the launching script will emmit its process ID.(PERSON3) We have a workers which all produce log files, <unintelligible> we have here are actually docker container ID is and we can look this is what one of the log files looks like.So we we have the system that works okay this way, I would prefer to find <unintelligible> the workers not resetting this so much more, for the [PROJECT1].And I dont have the ASR workers <unintelligible> running in an screen session <unintelligible> right now, normally we dont have ten of them.It will be also be possible to have a script to make restarting one faster but mapping them to session IDs and making the script available online is a lot <unintelligible>, just simply can not <unintelligible>.But if you could at least make sure that you can restart them with just one command and not like moving to some screen, and and so on, and then looking up which command.I would like to see, uh, how do you tell a dead worker from a working worker, because I really do not like the idea of you restarting all of them.(PERSON3) So that the thing is, in theory this log output will indicate if this worker is in fact idle and is in fact new connection <unintelligible>.(PERSON1) <parallel_talk>
So [PERSON13] would know if the session ID, [PERSON13].Because  I assume that you can compile it.And that would say:" I've got this session ID from the [ORGANIZATION2] mediator.So then uh, I'm not like totally asking for uh, for this web interface killing but asking for speed up for you, so that we would tell you please restart worker for this session ID and.But for the, in the meantime, it will save a lot of nurse for and it will speed up.Written in each pocket,  receipt <unintelligible> mediator.(PERSON10) The XML which is the data XML, there is stream ID, which I actually dont know what it is.For you I remember that there were some issues with the move from the old mediator  version to the new mediator version.And the problem was exactly this Xml that you were lying on some custom XML library, and you had to switch these libraries.(PERSON10) When you have the <unintelligible> cloud packet, it will have the get session ID function
Will provide you the session ID.(PERSON1) Yeah, put it in the chat yes please.So I guess that if you, 
<parallel_talk>
So there is definitely way in which we could if you launch anything simple on your side then we should be able to reach it.<unintelligible>
(PERSON1) So that this is what you have already open, you have open SSH port on the on that machine, I'll share my screen.So if you launch one more simple thing there, that we could get in touch with, then it should work, and I'm now I look up simple.<laugh>
(PERSON3) <unintelligible>
(PERSON1) <unintelligible> Listen.But anyway, I think still having the session ID in the log would be very useful for you so that you could restart it right away.And I like you would see a message in the slak window, restart session ID and you would just run your own script restart session ID, and it would do the grapping and it would do the killing and it would do the restarting, so it would be one copy paste from slack to your screen and that would save us a lot of worries.(PERSON3) <unintelligible>
(PERSON1) Yep,yep,yep.(PERSON3) Sorry it is not correct, <unintelligible>.So I'll have to run now, but please prepare, please modify worker so that they show session ID and so that you have a simple script which would be something like restart by session ID.sh and we will send you session ID and yu would only do this, and it would do the right thing, and if you accidentaly run this on the wrong machine, which does not have this sesion ID the worker for the session ID it will tell you: "Well, I do not have that worker, you need to run me on the other other machine."<unintelligible>
(PERSON1) Yeah, okay.So thanks everybody I dunno of you want to stay on the call, or but please whoever can please keep debugging with [PERSON9] and speak to you or at least talk, write to you on slack tomorrow.
