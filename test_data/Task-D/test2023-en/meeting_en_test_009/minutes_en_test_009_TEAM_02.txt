i don't want to create twenty minutes myself even two, i think we should just evaluate.
i'm afraid i have to leave now already.
i'm going to propose [PERSON4].
parallel_talk> password unintelligible> 2019..
the same asr worker type is launched as many times as there is the target languages.
there is nothing in the protocol unintelligible> will help us problems solution.
if you could just.
quickly share the screen where you had the the launch of ten workers at the same time like underneath of each other..
the eb client has a problem with unintelligible> of the asr workers.
i killed the eb client, but i just unintelligible> its return, and it works sometimes.
i'm going to run it on one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten on on one 30 second audio..
the machine translation workers seem to be working well, right? the only thing that comes to my mind would be.
the multiplexing worker, or other actually the ultiplexing client.
the problem is that when when we see we send to whole text file at once.
and we have to wait for the segmenter to process it but in this this case unintelligible> not at once..
i'm afraid that you have low availability because [PERSON12] is away.
or will be.
i'm trying to upload different.
yet another update, but its very slow.
i'm not sure if you can hear us.
so pleased wait a bit..
i'm going to run six publishers, but they are not actually operation.
i haven't seen any of the subtitles in my view of of the presentation platform.
i guess it should not be related to the new authentication that is in the presentation platform..
i can run the exact configuration i've been posting, i can run it on the local network.
i'm still trying to figure out what can, what can possibly interfere with that.
i am in the middle of pushing that the very same file in some additional instructions on on cruise control..
it is pretty been impossible to the debug problems in these environments.
we strongly suggest to select our preffered path at the beggining.
and the performer translation only of eternal tone of all the possible combinations..
"PERSON9" is capable of choosing the english sound.
it is possible to have the english subtitles presented from the main round table.
it has no way to to see which the english is which it will simply anyone who connects as little as a worker providing english will be displayed there..
cnn's john sutter looks at what could be causing the problem.
sutter says the problem is the partial hypothesis output.
he suggests performing as much as possible test today and tomorrow..
cnn's carl safina says he was not able to read the message at all.
safina: it could happen that you receive two long strings from the asr output.
he says the segmenter worker is preparing phrases for the machine translation.
safina: i'm afraid if there is like a logic implemented in two separate the components..
i'm adding that to the next call that i would like to make would be actually tomorrow.
i'm adding that to the next call that i would like to make would be actually tomorrow.
i'm adding that to the next call that i would like to make would be actually tomorrow..
on the admin web, it says that all all not available at the moment.
PERSON1 is concerned about empty workers not being used, while the they should be.
could there be a delay in the mediator in the admin interface?.
[PERSON11] tried to connect the unintelligible>, but he failed.
we will configure te presenation platform, english as the top priority source language.
but please if you change the test, tell us so that we can put german as top priority and so on..
i want to be there as much as possible and restart the workers unintelligible> as possible, but i can't guarantee that unintelligible> here at every minute.
i've asked [PERSON12] in the slack today, maybe you could setup very simple cgi script or php script or whatever, so that we could ping fixed url and tell it the session id of a worker, asr worker which is not functioning..
cnn's john defterios looks at the logs of a web server.
he thinks it would be very useful to have a web server that could kill workers.
defterios says he has no experience in coding in any web server package..
i would prefer to find unintelligible> the workers not resetting this so much more.
i don't have the asr workers unintelligible> running in an screen session right now, normally we dont have ten of them.
i would like to see how do you tell a dead worker from a working worker, because i really do not like the idea of you restarting all of them..
in theory this log output will indicate if this worker is in fact idle.
in the protocol.
when there is this connected to server medi- mediator, its like one third of the page.
and before the first message waiting for the client.
(PERSON3) yeah, i have not tried recompiling..
i'm unintelligible> able to access the source code of my workers.
i'm also unintelligible> more complicated with the workers because they are running on different services.
if you launch something simple on your side then we should be able to reach it..
can you run can you run this? can you run can you run this? can you run can you run this? can you run can you run this?.
