MEETING MINUTES
Organisation: [ORGANIZATION1], [ORGANIZATION2]
Meeting Name: [PROJECT3] 
Meeting Date: 31.08.2020
Meeting Topic: General Progress Meeting
Meeting Participants: [PERSON2], [PERSON10], [PERSON6], [PERSON3] 
Meeting purpose:  To provide regular progress update on tasks at hand.
Main topics of discussion:
[PROJECT6]
•	Slow and intermittent communication with the [ORGANIZATION3] team. Might be raised at the regular monthly call.
•	Obstacle caused by expired certificate on the server performing the expected quality estimation has now been resolved.
•	Leaflet for participants is under preparation.
[PROJECT1]
•	Progress was outlined separately in the email communication.
•	Translation to be run on the CPUs.
•	Further steps to be discussed within the week with another colleague.
[PROJECT4]
•	Reference made to the [PROJECT5] paper focusing on training the model to perform evaluation.
•	Certain scepticism expressed towards the machine learned evaluation in relation to the sensitivity to domain shifts.
•	Potential problem with efficiency of Bleu score bases evaluation in scenario when decoder is using sentence with the same meaning but different words.
•	The paper argument is that the [PROJECT5] is actually creating semantically rich representations.
•	Suggestion made that the metric could be used by [LOCATION2] team in pre-training and development process.
•	For paraphrasing the metric can be used to estimate semantic similarity but still have a number of constraints to ensure certain surface form.
•	Metric to be stress tested to see how many constraints can be added before the resulted sentence has no actual meaning.
•	Non-standard metric is required to provide guaranteed semantic similarity and to rectify shortcomings of Bleu score methodology which focuses mainly on the surface form evaluation.
•	New ideas and further progress to be discussed following week.
•	Research directions are still subject to a potential change.

Organisational matters
•	Regular monthly call with project partners scheduled for Thursday 3rd September at 5PM CET. Participation open to all.
•	Work contract details, travel arrangements and general conditions discussed with a colleague joining the team from abroad.
