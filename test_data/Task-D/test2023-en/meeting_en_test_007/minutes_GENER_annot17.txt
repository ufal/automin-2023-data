[PROJECT3] Internal
Date: 31. 08. 2020
Attendees: [PERSON2], [PERSON6], [PERSON10], [PERSON3], [PERSON1]
Purpose of meeting: discussing project updates: [PROJECT6], [PROJECT1], [PROJECT4].

- Discussing organizational matters. 
-- A call with the project partners happens monthly. 
-- One of the participants, who is from [LOCATION1], should come to [LOCATION2] to sign the work contract and other paperwork and see everybody in person.
--- There are related problems due to the situation: the [ORGANIZATION4] is closed and it currently does not give out visas.
--- Reached decision: as soon as the [ORGANIZATION4] starts giving out visas, he will come to [LOCATION2]. 

- Discussing the progress of [PROJECT6].
-- Waiting for [ORGANIZATION3], the communication with them is not perfect. 
-- Some issues have been raised by colleagues from [ORGANIZATION3].
--- For example, there is a problem with the quality estimation.
-- The colleagues from [ORGANIZATION3] are currently preparing leaflets to hand out to participants. 
-- All in all, just waiting for [ORGANIZATION3]. 

- Discussing the progress of [PROJECT1]. 
-- Currently trying the back translation.
-- Will try to run the translation on CPUs to make it quicker. 

- Discussing the progress of [PROJECT4].
-- No major updates.
-- Discussing a related paper, in which the authors trained a model to do the evaluation.
--- Skeptical about machine learned evaluation methods.
--- Not sure how/if it can be implemented right now.  
--- What might be useful is a pre-trained model that is then fine-tuned during training.
--- It would be useful for distinguishing in paraphrasing.
---- But this needs to be looked into in more detail. 
-- Discussing if there is really a need for this new non-standard metric for evaluation in MT.
--- Yes, it will be used for paraphrasing. 
--- This metric is semantically sensitive. 
--- This metric will be used to estimate semantic similarity, but still have the constraints to enforce distinction.
--- By using this metric, semantic similarity is guaranteed.
--- The metric will guarantee that the paraphrase does not stray away from the original meaning too far. 
--- We can try adding as many constraints we want to see how many we can add until the meaning is lost completely.
---- Meaning and losing meaning would be a valuable topic to focus on, since none of the papers on constraint decoding focus on it. 
-- Later, before publishing the paper, evaluation should be also done manually. 
-- All of this can be considered later, but it is a good start.
