---Such as work contract, hosting agreement and so on.
---He should arrive as soon as possible.

-What was discussed
--[PERSON9] prepares leaflets for participants.
--They will run the translation in CPUs.
---A lot of them are not used so they want to make it quicker.
--The problem is that they do not know how to implement it into a pipeline at that moment.
--[PROJECT5] is creating semantically rich reprsentations.
--If they take the pretrain model and fine-tune it during training it can be useful for distinguishing.
--The other metric can be used to guarantee that the paraphrase is as close as possible to the original meaning.
---They will add as many constraints as they lose the meaning completely.
---And check how many contraints it can handle to not be misleading.

-Concerns, decisions, ideas
--Problem with the quality estimation.
--Concerns aboout evaluation.
---The method can be misleading in giving a score.
--Concerns about a decorder generaing sentences that have the same meaning but include different words.
