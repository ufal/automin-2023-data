 Purpose of meeting: Regular meeting - actualities and task progress.

Summary of meeting:

[PERSON6], [PERSON10]
- Inform about regular meeting on Thursday, 5 pm [LOCATION2] time.
- It is possible to join but it is not necessary.
- [PERSON10] probably is not at mailing list yet, [PERSON6] take care about it.

[PERSON6], [PERSON10], [PERSON1]
- Explain the situation with work contract for [PERSON10].
- It is needed to come personally to [LOCATION2] as soon as it would be possible.

[PERSON2], [PERSON6], [PERSON3]
- Discuss progress with [PROJECT6].
- The server just expired, and transfixed it.
- There are prepared the leaflets and would be handing out to participants.
- It has been discussed at Thursday meeting.
- There is not perfect communication.

[PERSON2], [PERSON6]
- Discuss [PROJECT1].
- It is worked on the back translation.
- On the cluster are fourty jobs, but they are low priority.
- The translation will be maybe run on CPUs, because there are many CPUs that are now not used.

[PERSON6], [PERSON10], [PERSON2]
- There were basically training a model to do the metric evaluation.
- It might be useful, but it is not sure if it could be used for the evaluation itself.
- It might be somehow implemented into the pipeline.
- It seems it might be useful approach in the paper, it is good to keep that in mind.
- The problem is if the decoder generates a sentence that has the same meaning but different words.
- The argument is that the [PROJECT5] is actually creating semantically rich representations.
- This metric can be used to guarantee that the paraphrase or the alternative sentence does not stray away from the original meaning too far.
- The idea is that we could add as many constraints we want and see how many can we add until we lose the meaning completely.
- Check the point where it starts making no sense.
- That would be the valuable.
- It will be discussed more.


Next meeting: Next Thursday.
