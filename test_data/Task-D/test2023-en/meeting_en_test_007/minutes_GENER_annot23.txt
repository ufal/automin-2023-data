Date: 31. 08. 2020
Attendees: [PERSON10], [PERSON2], [PERSON3] [PERSON6], [PERSON1]
Purpose of meeting: Discussing [PROJECT6], [PROJECT1] and [PROJECT4]

-Call on Thursday
--It isn't necessary for everybody to join, but it might give more insight into the project.
--It is at 5 p.m. of [LOCATION2] time.

-[PERSON10]'s visit
--[PERSON10] will need to visit [LOCATION2] as soon as possible to enter a proper work contract.
--He needs to come for the paperwork, then return and work remotely.
--It would be better if he could stay here in person.
--[PERSON8] will provide the paperwork.

-[PROJECT6]
--They don't know whether [ORGANIZATION3] has started or not.
--The problem will be raised on the Thursday call.
--The certificate used for the quality estimation has just expired.
--Leaflets are being prepared, they will be handed out to the participants.

-[PROJECT4]
--They are trying the back translation.
--There are many CPUs that aren't being used now, so they could utilise them for the translations to make it quicker.

-[PROJECT4]
--They are still catching up with the state of the art.
--They are training a model to do the evaluation.
--There are doubts whether the model should be used for the evaluation itself, since it might be sensitive to domain shift.
--The [PROJECT5] is creating semantically rich representations.
--If they take the pre-trained model and fine-tune it during training, it might be useful for finding semantic similarities.
--The metric can be used to guarantee that the paraphrasing doesn't stray away from the original meaning.
--They will try and add as many constraints as they want and find when it loses the meaning.
--It could be valuable since the papers focused on the constraint decoding don't use this perspective.
