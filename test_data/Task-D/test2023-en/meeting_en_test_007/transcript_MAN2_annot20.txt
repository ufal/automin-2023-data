(PERSON2) Hi, [PERSON10].
(PERSON10) Hi, [PERSON2]. Is only us.
(PERSON2) We're still waiting for the others.
(PERSON10) Oh, here they are.
(PERSON2) Okay, [PERSON3] is here.
(PERSON10) Hi, [PERSON3].
(PERSON6) Hi.
(PERSON2) Hi.
(PERSON10) Hi, [PERSON6].
(PERSON6) Oh, uh, uh, we're waiting for someone, maybe, uh, that is going to join us, but I'm not sure.
And [PERSON1] is not going to join us today, so, other than that we are ready to start, I think.
So.
So, first, uh, something, some organational stuff uh.
There will be call on Thursday, you probably received the email from [PERSON4] already.
I think at least me, and [PERSON2] should be present, right?
Uh, anyone else if, if they want to join, like, there's no problem with that.
Uh, but I don't think it's completely necessary.
It might be good for [PERSON10] to get more insight into the project itself, I guess, but again it's –
(PERSON10) Sorry, this is, this is a meeting on Thursday?
(PERSON6) Oh, yeah.
So, so, this is a call we have usually every month with the, uh, other project partners.
I'm not sure, did you receive the e–mail from [PERSON4]?
(PERSON10) Uh, not sure, I'll check this, because, uh, I didn't see it at first.
(PERSON6) That's the good thing to check, because, uh, otherwise we, we should add you to the maidli– mailing list at least.
Because it's possible that you're not added yet.
(PERSON10) And maybe I have, I have one from [PERSON4] here, but no, it's about the, the GitHub.
I'll, I'll check this, and I will, uh, tell you later.
(PERSON6) You should rather look at that it's quite possible that you're not in the mailing list or, uh, yet. So, so –
(PERSON10) Yeah, okay.
(PERSON6) I will, I will take care it.
And I'm, uhm –
Okay.
(PERSON2) It's at 5 P.M. of our [LOCATION2] time.
(PERSON10) Perfect.
(PERSON6) It should be around 1 P.M.
(PERSON2) So, it should be like –
(PERSON10) Oh, we're having lunch in –
(PERSON2) 1 P.M.?
(PERSON10) No, 12. It's dinner.
(PERSON6) Hm.
(PERSON2) N– no, sorry, sorry, [PERSON6], what, wh– wh– what did you say?
(PERSON6) So, no, it might, it, it might be about 1 P.M. [LOCATION1] time, I'm not sure, what it is called.
It's not [LOCATION1] time, right, it's, it's, it's, uh, different –
(PERSON10) Well, it is, I think.
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) Oh, you actually call it [LOCATION1] time?
(PERSON10) Yeah.
(PERSON6) Oh, okay.
(PERSON10) Somet–
I call it like this, maybe, um, there's, there are other names, but –
It's –
(PERSON6) Probably it makes sense, so, yeah.
(PERSON2) Like simply said, it's 1 hour from now and 4 days –
<laugh/>
From –
<laugh/>
4 days and 1 hour from now.
(PERSON10) <laugh/>
Yeah.
In the future.
(PERSON2) <laugh/>
(PERSON6) So, okay, so, that's that.
Uh, yeah.
I'm, uh, yeah.
That, that's it.
And also, uh, [PERSON1] asked me, uh, to tell you [PERSON10] that you s– you should think about the possibility that –
Basically, the moment the travel restrictions are, uh, going d– go down.
We w– we would really like you to come visit us at least for, I don't know, for some limited time.
So, so, try to think about this, uh, as a, as a, as a mandatory visit.
Like, I'm, I'm not sure how, how it would be handled.
Like, the travel cost as such.
How –
You, you don't know, how, how is it going to –
So, so, here's [PERSON1].
(PERSON1) Hi. Yeah.
(PERSON10) Hi [PERSON1].
(PERSON1) I'm, I'm here but I'm not.
Yeah really busy with other things and it's on headphones so, I d– don't hear about this.
(PERSON6) Uh.
(PERSON1) Uh, yeah.
So, I just –
This is a remark, uh, that actually comes from the, uh, like, uh, personal department.
And, uh, the way they employed you, uh, is really, like, they, they had to close both of their eyes.
And, uh, the– they are not going against the law, but they are, uh, in a gap of the Czech law.
So, uh, they really take it as a, uh, temporary solution what they have now, uh, for you.
Uh, and, uh, it is important for you to come in person to, uh, enter a proper work contract.
Uh, so, uh, th– the hosting agreement and other paperwork that is being prepared really has to be used, uh, as soon as you can, uh, and as soon as you can arrive.
Uh, and, uh, the length of your duration, uh, I would prefer you to stay here but I know you, that you, uh, initially indicated that you would like to stay, uh, remote, if possible.
Uh, so, uh, just please keep that in mind.
And, uh, it would be better for us and better for the project if you decided to take it as an opportunity and not as a, as a negative must.
Uhm, as a negative duty.
Uhm, uh, but this is negotiable.
You, you will have to come, uh, for the paperwork and then you can possibly return and, and work remotely.
Uh, but, uh, it would be b– nicer and better, uh, if, if you decide to, to stay here in person.
(PERSON10) Okay, great.
(PERSON1) Yeah okay so –
(PERSON6) I think we will keep you updated, uh, when we will <unintelligible/> –
(PERSON10) Okay, yeah.
Uh, uh, tha– tha– there's a date for this, I mean, there's a –
(PERSON1) The sooner, the better.
(PERSON10) The sooner, the better, okay.
Yeah but I, I was still – didn't receive the, the letter from, from you.
And, uh, that's coming from may or.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so, the letter is <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON10) <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON1) That is a paper that has to be shown to the [ORGANIZATION4] when you are applying for the visa.
And I believe that the [ORGANIZATION4] is still closed, isn't it?
(PERSON10) Oh, I, I, I'm not sure about that.
I'll have to check this.
(PERSON1) If you please start checking, what would be the process for you to apply for, uh, for visa.
Uhm and the paperwork, uh, will come from [PERSON8].
So, check with [PERSON8], what is the status, uh, of that.
Uh, and, uh, uh, yeah.
I, I think that you at the moment, you cannot apply simply because the [ORGANIZATION4] is closed.
Uh –
(PERSON10) Okay.
(PERSON1) But that –
I know this for the Indian [ORGANIZATION4] because we have other people who are trying to come here and they really want to come, uh, is from India and they cannot.
So, uh, I'm, I, I'm, I fear that the same situation is for [LOCATION1].
(PERSON10) Yeah.
(PERSON1) So, keep checking and –
(PERSON10) Okay.
(PERSON1) We will also, occasionally check for you and as soon as you can apply for visa, then please go for it.
And you will get the full support from the university, the, uh, to show them papers they need and, and so on.
(PERSON10) Great, great.
Okay, I will, I'll keep checking and as soon as I can, I, I go.
<laugh/>
(PERSON1) Yeah.
<laugh/>
Thanks.
(PERSON10) Thank you.
(PERSON6) Okay, so, so, I think that's care of the –
That's it for the organizational stuff.
So, now for the progress, uh, okay.
Uh, can we start with [PROJECT3]?
Or I'm looking at it, at we are still waiting for –
How, how is it with [ORGANIZATION3]?
Do you have any updates?
(PERSON2) Uh, as I <unintelligible/>.
Yeah. Uh.
So, last week, uhm.
I, uh, nudged, uhm, [PERSON9] that he should do something and then, yeah, he, he starts to or like finish testing it and thanks to [PERSON3] for resolving all the issues that, that like [PERSON9] came across.
And raised again and, uh, yeah, because we, we were at the time we, were at the wedding and like after the wedding.
<laugh/>
So, so, thanks to [PERSON3] for like resolving this.
And then I replied to him, I mean to, to [PERSON9], on Friday and I have no messages from [PERSON9] since last Thursday.
So, I again, the same situation, I don't know whether they started it or not.
(PERSON6) We can definitely raise that on the Thursday call, maybe it ne–
The thing that the communication is not completely perfect and, uh.
It, it's sort of like a –
(PERSON2) Like it i– like it is fine, but, uh, yeah, uhm.
The problem is that, uh, I think like [PERSON9] raises issues, new and new issues.
(PERSON6) Hm.
(PERSON2) And yeah.
So.
(PERSON6) Yeah, so, definitely we can at least –
(PERSON2) There is also, some objective problem with the quality estimation or I, I don't know maybe.
Maybe [PERSON3] has more for this.
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) We can't hear you.
(PERSON5) Expiring.
But that is not this.
(PERSON2) We can barely hear you, [PERSON3].
(PERSON5) Uh, sorry.
Uhm.
(PERSON2) Uh, so, what?
(PERSON5) Uh.
(PERSON2) I cannot hear anybody now, so.
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) No, no one is talking, right.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON6) Uh.
Well anyways, uh.
We should, we should ask –
(PERSON5) Sorry, is it better?
(PERSON2) Yeah, yeah, now it's better.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON5) Yeah, uh, sorr–
Uh, so, to comment on that, uh, the certificate, uh, on the server of that plane who does the <unintelligible/> just expired.
And transfixed it and that's it.
And now, uh, the state is that, uh, [PERSON9] is preparing the leaflets, he would be handing out to, to participants and that's it.
(PERSON2) Uh, okay.
(PERSON5) So, now we are just waiting.
(PERSON2) Hm.
(PERSON5) But –
(PERSON2) Yeah, something that he could prepare three weeks earlier and yeah.
(PERSON5) Or three months ago, yeah.
(PERSON2) Or three months ago.
<laugh/>
(PERSON5) Yeah.
(PERSON2) Okay.
So, hopefully next year we will publish a paper.
(PERSON6) <laugh/>
(PERSON2) <laugh/>
(PERSON6) Okay, so, so, next, uh, let's go to [PROJECT1].
I think that, uh, the, the bullet point is quite explanati–
Like, what's the term.
Like, I, I, get what, what, what is the progress right now.
Like you, you're trying the back translation, right?
(PERSON2) Yeah.
Hm.
(PERSON6) So, that's the, that's the forty jobs that's are, that are on the cluster, or?
(PERSON2) Yeah.
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) Like I've notice that you –
(PERSON2) <laugh/>
That's it.
<laugh/>
But they are a low priority, so, you can –
They are just minus one hundred priorities, you can skip them, if you, if you need.
(PERSON6) Okay.
But they are, they are already running, right?
(PERSON2) Yeah, but, uh, every job takes two hours, so –
(PERSON6) Oh, okay.
So, it's fine.
(PERSON2) So, it's nothing that –
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, that's, that's quite –
(PERSON2) If you, if you secure your own job like in two hours, it will be on.
(PERSON6) Okay.
Okay.
I hope so. 
<laugh/>
(PERSON2) <laugh/>
(PERSON6) So, ok, so, the –
Let's, let's, let's –
Yeah.
It's, it's progress <unintelligible/>.
Like, uh, is there any, was there any issue, something that needs to be discussed?
(PERSON2) Hm, not yet.
Like uh –
(PERSON6) Ok, <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Yeah, we have to like in this week, I have to, uh, discuss things with [PERSON7], what should we do next.
(PERSON6) Hm.
Okay, so, the, the –
(PERSON2) I will also, maybe run this, uh, translation on CPUs, because there are many CPUs that are now not used, so, just to, uh, make it quicker.
(PERSON6) So, I guess that leaves us with the [PROJECT4].
Like, uh, any, any updates?
(PERSON10) Yeah, no.
No mo– updates for now.
(PERSON6) Oh ye–, w–
Oh yeah, we already discussed right that you're, you're, you're s– still catching up with the state of the art.
Actually, actually, I was read, I was, well not reading, but I, I skimmed through the paper on the BLUE.
And if I understood correctly, they were basically training a model to do the, uh, evaluation, right? So –
(PERSON10) Yes, the metric, yeah.
(PERSON6) Hm.
So, the thing is that it might be useful, but I'm not completely sure whether we would like or how w–
Uh, whether we can use it for the evaluation itself.
I'm really, like always s– sceptical to these machine-learned evaluation methods, right?
Because they might be sensitive to domain shift and, and such, right?
(PERSON10) Yes.
(PERSON6) So, even if the method tells, uh, the score or the performance is low, it might not be actually true.
But, yeah, I, I'm thinking that, that it might be implemented into the pipeline somehow, but –
I– in my case, also, I, I, I, don't know, don't know exactly how we can add it or include it right now.
But that seems like –
(PERSON10) The problem –
Sorry.
(PERSON6) And it, it seems that it ma– might be useful that the, the approach they, they take there in in the paper, so, so, definitely good thing to keep that in mind.
(PERSON10) Yeah.
The, the problem is that if, uh, the decoder generates a sentence that is, uh, has the same meaning, but different words, maybe we have a problem trying to use just blue, right?
So, can try do both and check the differences and, and stuff.
Or I don't know.
(PERSON6) Yeah, d–, yeah definitely.
I think that the idea –
I'm not sure –
Like they, they, uh, uh, their argument about the metric being semantically sensitive, or what's the term?
(PERSON10) Yeah.
(PERSON6) Like the argument is that the [PROJECT5] is actually creating semantically rich representations, right?
(PERSON10) Yeah.
(PERSON6) Hm, so, yeah.
I think if we, if we sort of maybe take the pretrain model and, and fine–tune it during training it might be actually useful for, for this kind of distinguishing.
Like, right, uh, I guess with paraphrasing or if we use it for example for paraphrasing, we might use the metric to, uh, estimate the sim– sim– simil– like semantic similarity, but still have the constraints to enforce some, some like surc– surface form.
Uh, distinction or something like that, I guess.
Like that's, that's, that's the thing that comes to my mind, but, uh, again, I also, need to look into it in more, in more detail.
(PERSON10) Okay, yeah.
Okay.
(PERSON2) Uh, maybe just like my stupid question, why do we need this eva– new evaluation for MT?
It's, uh, because of that, uh, like case of paraphrases, that bo–, <unintelligible/> is in fact measuring the similarity, not the diversity, or?
(PERSON6) No, so, I, I can –
(PERSON2) Why do we need like another like non–standard metric?
For evaluation?
(PERSON6) Uh, well technically we can use it either for –
Well, yeah, probably for the paraphrasing, right.
And the thing is that we want to kinda guarantee a semantic similarity, right, which BLEU doesn't capture, because it's just using the surface forms during evaluation.
But on the other hand, we like again, we can, we can force the system to choose different wordings, different phrases and this kind of –
And this blurred metric can be used to guarantee that the, the, the paraphrase or the alternative sentence does not straight– stray away from the original meaning too far, right?
(PERSON2) Yeah, yeah, hm.
(PERSON6) So –
(PERSON10) So, d–, sorry, just complementing.
Uh, the idea is that w– we could add as many, as many constraints we want and, and see ho–how many can we add until we lose the meaning completely.
(PERSON2) Hm, okay, okay.
(PERSON10) So –
We check the point where it changes, where it starts making no sense.
(PERSON2) Hm.
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, I, I think, I think that we can focus on this.
Uh –
(PERSON2) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds like fine.
(PERSON10) Yeah, I, I don't know it was, uh, addition idea that I think that we can work on for now until we have new ideas.
(PERSON2) Hm.
(PERSON6) Yeah, this is –  this definitely sounds interesting, because again, I think that the papers that do focus on the constraint decoding, they, they really don't evaluate it from this perspective, right?
So, that would be the valuable, uh, thing, yes.
Still, still, I guess the metric can be, can be useful during the, let's say, some, some fine–tuning or development phase.
And maybe later when we are ready to publish the paper, we should definitely still, uh, generate some subset –
(PERSON2) Evaluate manually.
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, definitely.
But we, we can talk, talk about it, or consider it later.
Uh, yeah, so, that's, that's a good start.
Uhm, I'm not sure, do you want to have a longer meeting this week t– about the [PROJECT4], like?
You have –
(PERSON10) I don't think it's necessary, at least, uh, y– it would be today, right?
After this one.
(PERSON6) Ye– well we can, we can, uh, yeah.
We can still discuss the matter after the meeting, uh.
I was thinking, yeah –
Okay, later, let's keep it that way.
(PERSON10) Oh, but I –
It's up to you guys.
I'm, I, I'm okay, I will keep, uh, until I have new ideas or new alternatives –
(PERSON6) Okay.
So –
Well –
Let's pu– put it this way, like, if you, if you don't have a–anything to discuss, we can leave it at –
Like leave it b– let it, be it for this week.
And, uh, I'll, I'll try to ask [PERSON1] and we, we should, we should try to have a, a meeting for the task next week together with him.
So, he can, he can give us hi– his opinion too, right?
(PERSON10) Okay, yeah.
I'll try to give – to have some ideas until them – to maybe an alternative to the alternative, okay?
(PERSON6) Hm. Hm.
Ye–, uh, well but then I think like this, this might be a good, good approach to the, to the task.
We'll, We'll see, we will see how much time it will take, depending on the, on the, on the time consumption, we can then, uh, shift to, uh, additional or another, another research direction.
Like – but, again, that depends, we will see how, how this develops. 
Yeah.
(PERSON10) Okay.
(PERSON6) So, okay, good.
Seems that we've discussed everything we needed.
So, we can, uh –
<another_language/>
Again.
I'm sort of really bad in English today.
But yeah, we can, we can wrap it up, and I guess see you, see you next week, right?
Or is there anything, uh, else you would like to discuss, any of you?
(PERSON2) No.
(PERSON10) No.
(PERSON6) Okay, so, yeah.
Thanks, thanks for your time and see you next week.
(PERSON10) Thank you.
(PERSON2) Okay, see you.
(PERSON10) See ya.
(PERSON2) Bye.
(PERSON10) Bye.
