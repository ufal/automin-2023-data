-Read the paper for the visa application, and see if it has been closed or not closed (or not closed at the time of application) or if it has been opened.
-Check the status of your visa with the [PERSON8], what visa status you are at the moment, if you apply for a work visa, will come from [PERSON8].
-If you are a student from another country, you can apply for a visa to study in the country of your choice, you will get the full support from your university.
-[PERSON9] raises some new issues and we should ask more questions about the problem (that is not completely perfect communication) and (that is not completely perfect).
-laugh> Okay, we are waiting for the year, which is three months ago, which is three months ago, which is three months ago.
-First of all we need to talk about the bullet point, which is the term that we're trying to translate right now, so that we can get what we're trying right now.
-The cluster or cluster is the number of jobs that are on the cluster or cluster or are on the cluster or are on the cluster or are on the cluster or are on the cluster.
-laugh> (laugh>) – They are low priority, so you can skip them if you need, laugh> (laugh>).

-The state art is the most boring part of all the trainings and the evaluation is the most boring part of the trainings and the evaluation is the most boring part of the trainings.
-Evaluate the domain shift using the machine evaluation methods.<n>Evaluate the domain shift using the machine-learned evaluation methods, whether the domain shift is sensitive or not.
-The decoder generates a sentence with same meaning but different words, the difference is (blue) and the decoder generates a sentence with same meaning but different words.
-Like the argument about the [PROJECTis actually creating semantically rich representations right?, the argument about the [PROJECTis actually creating semantically rich representations right?
-The reason why we need this eva– new evaluation for MT is because we don't know the differences between MT and other systems, so we need a new evaluation.
-Ask yourself why we need a standard metric for evaluation?, why we need a non–standard metric for evaluation?, why we need a standard metric for evaluation?
-The other way is that we can use the system to choose different wordings of different phrases – We can use the system to choose different wordings of different phrases.
-The constraint idea is that w– we could add as many constraints as we want to see ho–how many constraints we could add to see ho–how many constraints we lose completely.
-Check the point where it changes making no sense – I think we can work on this now until we have new ideas for new ideas for new ideas for this.
-The constraint can be useful during the development phase, fine–tuning or development phase of the paper, to evaluate the paper from this perspective right from this perspective.
-[PROJECT4], I think it's a good idea to have a longer meeting about this weekt– about the [PROJECT4], like.
-We can still discuss the matter after meeting I was thinking yeah – It's up to you guys to discuss new ideas or new alternatives – It's up to you guys.
-So we've discussed everything we needed to discuss, we can wrap up the discussion and we can wrap up the discussion for the week.<n>So we can wrap up the discussion for the week.
