-Free circulation is the most important thing in the region of South Asia, it is the most important thing for the people of the region.<n>If you are in same region, you have to wait until 4th of June for free circulation.
-Finally, I will reach my parents, because they live in two different cities, Trento and Bolzano, which is pretty near 50 kilometres (laugh>).
-So I went to park the yestreday and I was really happy that I kept my distance from everyone but I was really happy that I kept my distance from everyone.
-After the regular meeting (which will be be online meeting) we have to postpone review (one of) our regular meeting (which will be online meeting).
-Put the summarization review in the right place, so that you can review it and get feedback from other users, the summarization review users.
-For this D7 2 do I understand correctly [PERSON11, please correct me], I think we should ask for an extension for this deliver, Congress has not taken place.
-Cross review between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], so we should review (or not review) each other's [ORGANIZATION].
-First of all we need to manage project management guide from previous project, because we have no idea what to manage this project management guide from previous project and there must be some project management guide from previous project.
-Self organization is the key to success of any IT project, whether it be data management, reports, project management guides, it all depends on the project management guides.
-If you are planning to coordinate future projects, you should have a little incentive to read the EU projects about which are about to coordinate the EU projects for the partners.
-Review kind, end of the beginning, the beginning, the beginning, the end of the beginning, the beginning, the end of the beginning, the end of the beginning, the beginning of the beginning, the beginning of the beginning, the beginning of the beginning of the beginning,
-Have another deliverable in December, the end of the year 2 test set, that's due end of August, that's due end of August.
-Test sets are the most important part of the deliverable, because they are the most important part of the test sets that are responsible for the delivery of the deliverable.
-[PERSON2], Please pick up on the layout test sets of the repository and also that we should have all other languages and also that we should submit all other languages regularly.
-So we are trying to have a repository for all of the speech languages and also for all the other languages.<n>Other_noise> list for those who like clever.
-sacrebleu is a metric that can be used to evaluate the text of a group of data.<n>So this definition of evaluation metric is not a true evaluation metric and thats separatelly.
-Download and install the latest version of FLAC from http://www.fac.org/android/packages/proJECT test set and then download the file list name.
-Max test sets really quickly sacrebleu. Yeah, I have observed that Max test sets really quickly sacrebleu sacrebleu.
-The public use of test sets should be limited few those those test sets that are concept to use for the general public use of the test sets that is interesting.
-For general public there should be at least 3 file lists, this would clearly indicate which version of software was used and would be downloadable automatically sacrebleu.
-So for evaluation tool we're still working on SLTF which is private repository and we're still working on the audible testing for share task evaluation.
-The main goal of the SLTF is to evaluate the translation of spoken English to English (ASL) by the machine translation system, for example, sacrebleu.
-The more interesting thing about button translation is that you can actually use it to improve the translation of text evaluation marks and the more interesting thing about the spoken language translation.
-The problem is that there is no such thing as SLTF (which is the standard algorithm for dealing with latency) and there is no such thing as SLTF (which is the standard algorithm for dealing with latency).
-The time stamps are given by participants to the task team, so that we can evaluate the translation quality of the model and also the translation quality of the model.
-Evaluating latency - This is the most important part of the SLTF, is to evaluate the latency of the model, whether it is set up or not.
-Send the source code, the sou lock file, the source code, the sou lock file, the sou lock file, the source code.
-Use the old time stamps   for tasks that should be done by participants, not by participants, but by the participants themselves, and then trust the participants.
-There are many different ways to measure the reliability of a model or a service model or a service model or a model or a service model or a service model.
-The translations are being made or revised, the task is to find the translations, the translations are being made or revised, the task is to find the translations.
-One could just trust automatic processing and maybe use some quality automatic quality measures (such as speech domain auditing domain (paralel??) to find related data sets.
