Attendees: [PERSON8], [PERSON6], [PERSON3], [PERSON11], [PERSON5]

Summary:
is not here , [PERSON5] is not sure whether he will be joining today , but maybe he will , remotely . and other than that [PERSON5] think that is that is everyone . but [PERSON6] is not sure whether [PERSON6] should talk about it , when . 

[PERSON3] do not know , other than that looking [PROJECT5] ,[PERSON11] are preparing the paper for the [PROJECT1] , [PERSON3] see . just today [PERSON6] finished the reviewer comments . 

[PERSON6] shall still need to read through it . And [PERSON6] could just briefly comment on the number of participants . 

[PERSON8] start writing the a paper just to organize the ideas . 

[PERSON8] do not know , maybe writing things , we can think about alternatives or limitations . Umfar [PERSON8] just organize the sections in bullet points . 

[PERSON5] heard that the [ORGANIZATION6] deadline has been moved , there is some extension that . But maybe [PERSON8] is wrong [PERSON8] [PERSON8] . 

[PERSON3] is really starting to write this week . let us let us tell that also to [PERSON11] , because he seems like he will not make it until Sunday , but this might help him a lot . Like that's , three more weeks , if [PERSON3] is correct . one thing that [PERSON8] need to say is that [PERSON8] . 

[PERSON5] told us about the data set that has multireference . it will be useful if [PERSON8] can access it . 

[PERSON3] asked  it is not even expected to have results for this deadline , right ? that is that is the biggest one [PERSON5] think we have . And that is if [PERSON5] is not mistaken about six hundred unique source sentences . but think about which composition of the data set is the most useful for [PERSON8] . 

[PERSON8] can check and choose the best one . because , there was a meeting last Thursday and [PERSON3] think we covered , everything we need . Or at least , [PERSON3] did not receive any email from them . but should [PERSON6] now just wait for the number of sentences ? Maybe it would be good if [PERSON5] could just [ping] [PERSON7] if they are moving , because they want this fast , but they still have not provided the people . 

[PERSON6] wrote some emails , but got no reply . 

[PERSON6] do not know , just [PERSON6] feel like [ORGANIZATION7]seriously dropped the ball this project . 

[PERSON11] and [PERSON6] are [very] frustrated . But the problem is that [PERSON4] is taking care of this and he will be leaving the project . Maybe it would be good idea to ask who is taking over , and start bothering the other person with this . maybe ask [PERSON12] to simply , have someone do the simplest thing , just to forward that those emails and get those speakers . But [PERSON3] is not sure how old that advertisement . 

[PERSON6] asked  Like what other graphs , what . 

[PERSON3] asked  It seems that [PERSON11] know , it is progressing , right ? [PERSON11] is running the back translation , monolingual data . Because [PERSON3] was killing some jobs today . as for [PERSON2]'s contribution , it is still lower and lower . if [PERSON3] need some technical help , let [PERSON3] know , [PERSON3] can probably chip in . 

[PERSON11] asked  Should it be accompanied with a paper , or it is just the demonstration ? [PERSON5] always expek a fourpage paper . 

[PERSON11] asked  , [PERSON5] is going to write to [PERSON12] , just to manage things in [ORGANIZATION7] , ? And sorry , and have [PERSON11] discussed like our capabilities of disseminating this advert . we have got that covered , we will see what [PERSON12] will , do .
