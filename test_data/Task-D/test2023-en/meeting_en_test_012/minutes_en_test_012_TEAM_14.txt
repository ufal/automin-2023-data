Not always, when (PERSON4) are never the host.
(PERSON20)'m really looking forward to it.
[PERSON9], will would [R]PERSON20] - (PERSON20) can trust the statistics? [R8], will [R6], would [P1ERSON9], would [MERSON9] could trust the data? [P3], will be [P2ERSON4] - [P3] can [P6], could [P7], could trust [P8], could not trust the] [P5], could (P7] could trust this data?
And actually the participants meeting spoke about the data set yesterday and probably it would be nice if the participants the meeting speak about consents today.
The participants meeting have English meetings and Czech meetings.
Find proper nouns the names that the participants of meeting want to change, and then the participants replace them in both English and Czech meetings.
To identify the proper nouns.
(PERSON20) think it should be possible at least for the common nouns that are repeating from English meetings to Czech ones.
The participants the meeting have good models for named entity recognition.
(PERSON20) can see that it change just
Participants the meeting can just remove some of them automatically.
Yes, okay - something in the meetings as (PERSON20) can see here the name of speeker is defind here.
Remove, but in this in this case the participants the meeting will participants of meeting have no diarizations or division into speakers.
(PERSON20) is not sure if the participants of meeting have brackets and something inside of brackets - It should be unified somehow to keep information that the speakers changed.
The only thing that could be r possibly kept is [PERSON3], because as (PERSON4) had (PASTER1) own experience everybody here he is talking about eighty percent the meeting.
And something else is that some words (PERSON4) can see that they end with this - The word didn't, the word didnt wasn't ended.
ja jenom jsem ti chtela rict, kdybys nahodou mohl jestli by ses k nam nepripojil na ten meeting.
