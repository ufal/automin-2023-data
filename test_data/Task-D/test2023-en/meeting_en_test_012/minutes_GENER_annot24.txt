- Small talk.
--Covid19 situation in the Czech Republic.
--Covid19 situation in India.
--Checking who is present.

- Named entity recognition model.
--There are mistakes to identify the proper nouns.
--UK has a good named entity recognition model.
--Maybe they need manual annotation.
--There should be special marks to recognise the individual speakers.
---Letters will be used for speakers, the question is if A, B, C or D etc.
--Assistance of [PERSON3] is needed, if he is free he should join the meeting.
--Words ending with dash-clarification, if the proper noun finishes with dash, it can be removed.
--Two step manual identification is suggested.
---This task will be assigned to the annotators, they will add A, B or C to each line, indicating name, not a name or question mark.
---Geographical names will also be anonymized.
---Name tag was introduced to one of the participants.
---Days of the week will not be considered as named entities, maybe it will be solved later on together with months.
---Work with name tag was described, at first stage the name tag should be trusted, then the rest of the words goes to annotators.
---Names of languages-are they proper names? Nobody knows.

-Information on end of session.

-Anonymization of the speakers' names.
--Angle brackets were suggested together with ID and hashtag.
--MT five sum is prefferred as it is not reversible.
--If there is some mistake due to misunderstanding in the transcript, it shouldn't be bothered with, otherwise it could go on forever.

-Information about [PERSON15].
--His involvement in the minuting will be limited due to PhD studies.
--The tool will be probably transferred to [PERSON20].
--[PERSON20] and [PERSON15] will have the session together.


-Mock annotation.
--Two people will do the test annotation and two people will do the evaluation, after that the problems will be discussed.

-Two participants left.

-Mock annotation is discussed in more details.
--The original idea is to read the transcripts and to produce the minutes and do the evaluation.
---Twenty or forty meetings should be selected?
---Who begins, who chooses the meetings, who chooses the number of meetings?
---Meeting are too long, reading and creating the minutes is a big work.
---Some participants don't agree with this approach, suggest just evaluating or preparing one meeting + minutes.
--Nobody knows the timing and how many transcripts they should read and process and why.
--[PERSON3] should answer these questions.
