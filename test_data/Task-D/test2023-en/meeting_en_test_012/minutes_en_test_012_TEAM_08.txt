(PERSON12) Eh, uh, not always, when I open the link I am never the host. (PERSON20) They don't report because -
Like there is a panic among the people like eh, the die solution centers are like not very much eh of good qualit. (PERSON20) So -
But the family members went ahead with the marriage. One of them is that we have two different meetings, two kinds of different meetings. I want to know your opinion and also I eh run eh named entity recognition on English meetings. Uh there no not -
But they are not repeating and not all of them are repeating. These are only Czech ones and eh and these are very qualitative meetings that is very good to use. So because they have very structured meetings and good minutes and eh all different people and different topics. For English models I use LNTJ eh, model which I guess is a good model. (PERSON9) So it's like, mm, let me say eh, we had seventy nine meetings at all. I can do, I can do it myself, but if there're annotators they can do it as well. (PERSON12) Yes , I can tell the annontators to -
(PERSON9) Yes, and something else -
The total number of names is (wrap??) But -
But I guess we can just we can just remove some of them automatically. (PERSON12) It should be unified somehow eh, to keep the information that the speakers changed. Okay, and I am not sure, should the letters correspond with the names that we are going to replace with real names for example -
(PERSON12) Hm, yes. (PERSON12) Here in brackets you have MI for example or KA and inside the transcript we will have Karen. And something else is that some words you can see that they end with this I don't know what you call it. [PERSON3] ja jenom jsem ti chtela rict, kdybys nahodou mohl, jestli by ses k nam nepripojil na ten meeting. Jo, resime proste resime s [PERSON9] a s nasima, s [PERSON20] a tak dal, jak budeme anonymizovat meetingy. But eh annonator could think that it this was an unfinished word. (PERSON12) Eh, in this case, it could be just removed from you is usually -
(PERSON9) But -
(PERSON12) I'm not sure -
So from the point of view of GDPR I could suppose if the word is not finished, it is not the name. I stop my video just the the reduce the band width again, but I'm also already listening. And that the precision should come from manual validation of that. And the manual validation should be done at the level of word types. We will immediately be able to say that all these words or most of these words, RAM is not that one. But uh, [PERSON11] is probably name, eh then [ORGANIZATION2] is already something that we want to  replace. So it's eeh, we can little bit improve the way we're collecting this list so that we also know the surrounding three, four words on each side. So I would not eh go for any decision like all the dashes are word boundaries. So that's the eh, that's a safe way, uh, so that eh if you use Mt five sum and then first five, uh, characters of that, or something like that. But it allows you to uh, to like arrive at the same eh ID immediately when you have the entity value. And so so I would eh label all these clear names in the data. So there is no need to look at the instance, anymore, and we will keep all the information that we have. So if you have -
(PERSON9) <parallel_speech> Yes I saw something -
Can you send me the link? (PERSON12) So it's actually one more <unintelligible>
(PERSON3) But January. We sh- could handle eh months, but the days are not important. (PERSON3) That's the way I see it, because like it's it's there too many days. So we can use the first letter, not use, not do not use the se- the second letter. (PERSON3) But you're definitely right that this list, uh, should be first, and you can already [PERSON9] who has just received the link from [PERSON12] as well. So this in the first phase separately name tag will pre-annotate this list. What name tag doesn't recognize here, give that to the annotators they will be assigning the name tag classes eh. And then uh, what is indicated as a named entity that will again be automatically uh, done on all occurrences. But we have decided at the token, uh, at that type level that it is not. So u- so for the second step I guess we need to provide the interface for the annotators. So one option is that for each occurrence of a named entity, uh, from the corpus. (PERSON3) You would create a line, which provides the context, so the same named entity would appear many times in this list in different contexts. Isn't it helpful if we indicate the number of eh -
(PERSON3) It is, yes. (PERSON3) I don't understand eh eh like -
(PERSON9) For example this marked happens in two meetings. If the annotator did decide that MOG can not be a name, which I don't agree with, right, eh eh if he decide it cannot be a name, then MOG will survive in the in the transcripts and ....
(PERSON12) Uhm hm. That means that we are eh obscuring one more word in the minutes. I think that the ideal situation is that we would know what is the full name of that person, because that name can also appear in the transcript. As that was, the law, with the laugh, with the law with the laugh there, right. So when doing the anonymization, I think that you should, uh, preserve the full name like [PERSON10] here on line one. So uh, so the angle bracket opened, slash, named entity and then angle bracket close. Then I don't think there is a big problem, too big of a problem. (PERSON3) Or tomorrow, I I'm not sure, it's like some internal deadline soonish, very soon and then some other like more serious deadlines for this proposal in the coming days. (PERSON9) Okay [PERSON12] if you don't have anything to do with me, I just -
(PERSON12) Yeah,
(PERSON9) I'll  do it as well. So we will read the transcripts and we will produce the summaries, the the minutes. And then the evaluators will evaluate them like using the procedure the manual procedure and will produce the eh the scores. Some of us, two of us will imitate the the summarization part. But who begins, who chooses the meetings, who chooses the number of meetings, when we'll do that. (PERSON12) Yes, so could you could you choose these meetings and send them to you and [PERSON20]? So you should choose -
(PERSON12) Okay, how many meetings would you like to get? (PERSON12) <laugh>
(PERSON20) Then <unintelligible>
(PERSON12) <laugh>
So annotators already created them. I actually I don't even understand why should we create minutes.
