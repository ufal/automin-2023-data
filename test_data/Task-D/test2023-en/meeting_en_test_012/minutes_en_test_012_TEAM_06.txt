PERSON12 ) hm PERSON12 ( PERSON9 ) . < q > it 's like , mm , let me say eh , we had seventy nine meetings at all . < q > eh 's the name of meeting and all of the names you can see PERSON12 is n't a zero information ( PERSON9 ) hm ( PERSON12 ) < q > it 's really changes a lot ( person billy ) in order to - - ( PERSON9 ] hm ) < q > people do n't know what is his name because we ca n't read the transcript acti- when being at the meeting he is extremely active so , we can give him a mark < q > eh maybe we can correspond o or ob to [ PERSON3 ] within the transcript PERSON12 ( PERSON12 ) eh , eh , is it [ PERSON17 ] , it 's not excluded ( ( ( PERSON9 ) ) < q > eh e-mailed him in a moment i have sent him , thank you ( PERSON9 ) < q > PERSON9 ( PERSON12 ) PERSON3 ( PERSON3 ) hi . i 'm here too am here too . < q > people are n't sure if the word is not finished , it should not anonymized ( ( PERSON9 ) < q > people can choose between three , four words on each side PERSON3 is eh 's two step manual eh identification ( PERSON3 ) < q > eh says it 's a ` safe way ' so that 's a safe way , so you can use mt five sum ' PERSON3 ( PERSON3 ) and PERSON3 ) are suspected to be a named entity < q > it 's not one at the type level ( ( PERSON9 ) , that 's what i had in mind ( ( PERSON3 `` ) < q > the data automatically would say in the data it would say < q > this is not a name and can not be unnamed , there is no need to anonymize PERSON12 ( PERSON12 ) has to be the same ( PERSON3 ) , says PERSON3 ) < q > it 's just important for me to in- in- in- in the annotators ( PERSON12 ] , `` says PERSON12 ( PERSON12 ) can chat - ( PERSON3 ) < q > it 's really the months and that 's that 's there is just twelve plus seven names that we can just like shuffle them later PERSON3 is not a big deal ( PERSON12 ) , but you 're definitely right that this list , should be first , and you can already [ PERSON9 ] who has just received the link from [ PERSON12 ] as well < q > eeeh , you can copy eh , a few lines from this , and it will immediately label it for you u- so for the second step i guess we need to provide the interface for the annotators ( PERSON3 ) < q > it 's a person 's name that will immediately make me make all occurrences of this in the data < q > what name tag does n't recognize here , give that to the annotators they will be assigning the name tag classes eh question mark if they do n't know , and a small w or something like that , which means this can not be a PERSON3 is n't it helpful if we indicate the number of eh - ( PERSON3 ) it is , it would be helpful and something else is that for example eh if this marked word for is the grey word < q > the question mark ( PERSON9 ) should we just eh should we indicate it as a suspicious word PERSON3 ( PERSON3 ) is the name of the PERSON3 ( PERSON12 ) PERSON3 ) < q > it 's a good question to discuss in the transcripts diarizations < q > the name is anonymize it means a , b , c , d unify all of them the anonymized version of PERSON3 ( PERSON12 ) and ( PERSON3 ) will eh < q > it will be identified as a name , at the type level probably < q > it 's named entity , person , id equals and then end of eh , named entity mt PERSON3 ( PERSON3 ) so use mt five and cut some , middle letters of that ( PERSON9 ) mhm , i got it ooh , so these are for each meetings , the kind of hashes < q > it 's not too common that the , well there is also this chang but that 's a misunderstanding actually . PERSON12 ( PERSON3 ) is a tool to help a little , but mainly to transfer that to PERSON20 < q > it 's like eh disturbing him from the topic , and he is hoping to come to [ LOCATION1 ] soon , because he still has the option two people will do some test evauation of these summaries < q > these people will take notes and write down what people have as problems < q > people will learn so much about the task that we want to do two annotators and two evaluators will take 20 meetings and 20 meetings < q > the two annotators will take let 's say twenty or fourty like twenty minutes , twenty meetings each one meeting is one hour long and to read the transcript < q > eeh , so it depends on a timing . so [ PERSON3 ] said that he spoke with you about this last week < q > but we spoke about one meeting ( PERSON19 ) and not about creating annotations
