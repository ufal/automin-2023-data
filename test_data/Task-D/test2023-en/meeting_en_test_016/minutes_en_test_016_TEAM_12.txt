so the news from me are that we had session like live workshop dry run at the LOCATION2 on wednesday and all the presentations went kind of well for the people who could understand other4 because that was run in other4 and people who had to rely on our subtitling were totally lost. so if anybody can join us if anybody does not speak other2 and would you have an idea what we would like to see what what what would be an interesting other2 talk please email us get in touch and we'll do it as as like joined watching.
