[PERSON8]: [OTHER6]: [Other4]:
[PERSON10] was saying that it looks like very like solution, like (PERSON8) know, hitting with hitting it with the hammer
Yes it's, (PERSON8) don't think it' is too bad solution, because it is intended for slides there is usually no, it''s not good for videos obviously, there is no way this would work for videos, but it is good for static slides, and the setup that the participants the meeting have on Monday seminars all the time and, other_noise>,.
(PERSON8) am studying also computer science.
[PERSON7] agreed to join us for the surge depending on his availability, he's or his some paper to finish that, like project to finish, to make into paper and then also help us in whatever is needed.
(PERSON7) also looked into pronounce and fluxes.
(PERSON10) would choose a replacement word and use the corresponding forms of replacement word.
other_noise>
[OTHER3], mostly, in [OTHER3 on other_noise> meeting.
[PERSON5], (PERSON8) dunno where is...
Okay (PERSON10) will get in touch with [PERSON5].
(PERSON8), if [PERSON8] received some domain input sentences, then (PERSON8) could search the database, and return a list of a singular sentence states and, some large focus it and should also work on word level.
[PERSON9] would use the files the that participants of meeting like find for the speaker, and as soon as the participants meeting have either (PERSON8) or [CERSON6], well that doesnt matter who does that.
[PERSON9], (PERSON8) can try to synchronize with [PASTER3], (PASTER4) can try,(PERSON10) is not sure how it can be like (POSTER9) just.
[PERSON9] some language model data related to (PERSON8)'s talk on Monday it will be, great if ( PERSON8) try to put this to Monday.
(PERSON8), [PERSON6], and [PASTER5], they mostly presentation platform and how it could be.
(PERSON8) also implemented a back end and front end, which is just a JavaScript piece code that can be included in any webpage even on a remote machine.
[PERSON5] could email.
[PERSON5] is observing the session, and he notices that something is too quiet, and or too loud he could mark down, number, next to image as well.
[PERSON10], visualisation, and also, also, (PERSON10) worked on other paraphrasing model.
Like many to many machine translation model and (PERSON10) used the cloud [OTHER5] to train it, at first, it just used a data set of 300 million open subtitles from various languages.
[ORGANIZATION2]: [PERSON8] is going to get it training today and hopefully (PERSON8) will have some results until the end of weekend.
[PROJECT5] is a neural network exchange format, that can be used to exchange neural network models.
Participants of meeting are running [PROJECT5] models which are trained in a similar way, but still well [OTHER1] serving.
[PERSON5] will collect the single number from their models in the in as they are in this setup but the participants of meeting should get to that in the two weeks of February at the latest.
(PERSON10) can provide all target languages that [OTHER3] can.
The best corpus is actually best file in the file which (PERSON8) have also translated into [OTHER2].
Okay, thank (PERSON10), great.
[PROJECT2] folder, [PERSON10] will copy all the files.
[ORGANIZATION2], yes, [PERSON10] already mentioned the parallel data extraction.
[PERSON7] send the path to all the source files that (PERSON7] have access to the clusters and [PION5,5] can run all the competition.
[PROJECT5] model on all this translation.
Just let (PERSON8) know, [PERSON8] is just going back next week to [OTHER3] work part time, and that's the reason (POSTER1) just had limited time for this project, and most (PASTER1)'s tasks are translations from [OTHER2] to [Other4] to feed anything.
The, and (PERSON10) is not able to run the script basically to deploy their worker on the mediator and the installation was succesful.
(PERSON10) observed that when [PERSON10] give the complete ASR output like at once segmenter, it gives a very impressive segments in text.
