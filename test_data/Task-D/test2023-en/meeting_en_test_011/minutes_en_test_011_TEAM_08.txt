[PERSON9] <another-language> Můžeme přidat ten mikrofon nebo - ? I still not hear very good, but, yeah -

Yeah, it is very, yeah, yeah, this is very nice paper. So maybe we we agreed that you you will you will do some probing on on transformer networks. And, I think we used to be interesting and with if <unintelligible> would be attention is in product placed -

[PERSON7] Sorry, I, now I haven't understand you at all. [PERSON5] And it seems like the the attention actually still manages to find still manages to find the proper subjects for the nouns particular the <unintelligible> about higher layers. Now it through doing [OTHER10]s but kind of stuff might also be <unintelligible> because they use like it's a confusion score the PSI too. [PERSON5] And what was this collaboration that you guys were talking about with the people in [LOCATION3]? But we haven't so far we haven't organized this call so we've do first create organized call here with the leader here of this group. [PERSON7] Okay, so maybe we can shift to to proceed to [PERSON6]. And and it's ee chunked down from much attention eh is focused of the first of words data in ee syntactic laytion. And We've to look what are the patterns of the eeh what difference actually our results from (though) measure <unintelligible> for [PERSON10] proposed one from different photo eh like one observation was that (for the), let's say easier <unintelligible> find the determiners or multifiers. But then it was quite good but say like the subject finding sub- object there's few one like one head that was specialized eeh looking for that particulation, let's say. Eeh it's most in fact <unintelligible> ultimate layer like there's like it's layer. [PERSON7] So I have better send the last the last last couple of the seconds. And the the higher layer  for components depend subjects was what was it was (balustrade) layer which have this rows was looking in to different eh eh chunks. [PERSON9] It seems that the different heads do different stuff. But -

Yeah, it seems they do different stuffs so it makes sense to try to seek which head those what try to hide them supportly, I guess. Then we realise that we have to switch to eeh some it was it eeh was the option. So, so, I I I want to say that it's not easy to eeh that there maybe different different settings and little bit difference settings of transformer that generates completely different results. The other papers don't don't report that there are some like balustrades maybe they have different different parametres a little bit, yeah. But I think <unintelligible>common factor in <unintelligible> paper some heads are a bit specialized in finding one high correlations <unintelligible>. [PERSON1] Actually, I wanted to try ehm extract the graph structures compare how how was like similar syntactic trees or or different types of trees we can (extract) from syntax. One aproach I think it can be checked for conclusions use the structure eeh with a with a graph conclusion layers. And they reported some improvements over using charts (RNM) which <unintelligible>. [PERSON7] Yeah, okay, and we should also, [PERSON5], [PERSON5] send me the paper where they they they had two two heads which are trained differently. And they, yeah, they train it together so they don't need they don't need the syntax annotation when translating so it's it's learnt. [PERSON7] Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly, definitely, add him, and yeah. [PERSON9] Did he contact you or he didn't contact you or we don't know? [PERSON5] So, I mean, I'll try the experiment tactogrammer and [OTHER10]s and -

[PERSON9] And so you were reworking on the manual (hewit) paper? [PERSON5] It seems to be <unintelligible> working on picture form. <laugh>

[PERSON5] The (excel) knows as best document <unintelligible> basicly there <unintelligible>. <laugh>

I don't know if [PERSON6] need to discuss something?
