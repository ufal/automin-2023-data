mary sorrow will be on the call on monday to talk about the proposed development schedule.
in-between will be (python sorrow) that's excepts sentences for translation from the [ORGANIZATION1] worker.

the only timestamps that we have are the beginnig and end of the sentence or unintelligible>.
so the only timestamps that we have are the beginnig and end of the sentence or unintelligible>.
i think that next week for example, you should know whether this proof of concept worked..
a textfield content can be sent several times as an update.
at some point the presentation platform would like to scroll it up.
a new message is a new subtitle to be displayed and it can subtitute the biggest one.
a new message is a new subtitle to be displayed and it can update the let's say the button of the textfield in order to let unintelligible>..

as long as the timestamp is the same, the field should be replaced with with the new content.
and if the timestamp is higher than the current the last text field should be like move to the history and and close..
do we plan to run any [ORGANIZATION2] workers in [LOCATION1]? we have not- we have decided not to use the [ORGANIZATION2] platform today.
essentially [ORGANIZATION2] is very far in the implementation..
i'm unintelligible> and ehm the things running on the same unintelligible> so, yeah, some we stand when we need more worker i think we have to stop limit number workers.
in in the long-term, it would be useful to have this image spread out for the various reasons that you mentioned, for the uh workshop itself we should be good..
asr worker the bug seems to happen when one worker can handle several sessions.
but then it stocks and it doesn't return any output.
i think it's very important that you create a script that replicates this bug..
if you click on this on this test that it's different different script.
it's the same as in the sample and it didn't for for me this week.
i wrote email to [PERSON6] and [PERSON11] and [PERSON9] but i'm not sure if [PERSON9] is the rigt persons for it..
