-Call some system by pipe, that should be easy to do, because there should be a system just by pipe available for translation worker, because if there is no system, it should be almost ready.
-For partial sentences, we should treat them from [PROJECT prospective as simple sentences other sentences that we expected process process process to process (or not process).
-If we have a single timestamp of the beginning and end of the sentence or, then we can compare these two timestamps and string comparison are sufficient for the presentation.
-How do we present partial translations and partial output, and how do we make sure that the updates are reasonably well displayed, for example, we had something like the textfiled.

-Now we need to discuss the history of text fields, whether it should be closed or updated. And we would be displaying the contents from this timestamp on.
-For [PERSON10] There is a development schedule for the presentation platform after we have discuss it on Monday, uh, there is a prototype available at a work point.
-There's no prototype available at the moment laugh> Okay, but when would we have a prototype today?--or when would they have one?
-The prototype should be presentable at the 15th of June, but this is only my information and is not guaranteed by any means laugh>.
-Probably development team have something close to be fine advertial to use as prototype, but we can have some working maybe for.
-Ask for a backup side of workers to be able to connect the room to the workers.
-The workers have one by one died out, the workers worked yesterday seemed there were totally know worker available, but the workers had one by One died out.
-If there is anything we can do in order to help the mediator test just your worker forsom Or anything else we stand us careful the Mediator test.
