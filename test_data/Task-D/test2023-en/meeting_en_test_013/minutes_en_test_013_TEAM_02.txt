slt is a complementary evaluation program.
the academy is like complementary evaluated.
it's important told to them that we most up to date ost versions are in the in some repositor, which you do not have acces to.
and so clean the code, thats it..
at the moment some of the files i would process in my unintelligible>.
do you need to create the support director in in a not unintelligible> and we have about unintelligible> and sltf evaluates, then we need to version it.
for the processing it's not not not important..

the antrecorp test directories..
emt deadline is tomorrow, so i have to leave [PERSON14], your real one with whom it work so far.
please synchronize with [PERSON14] on the on the audible slt test set and depth set forced alignment files.
the wav files should be also from the 16 kilohertz wav files.
