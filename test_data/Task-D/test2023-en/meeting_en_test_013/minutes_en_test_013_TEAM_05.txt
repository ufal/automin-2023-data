-[PERSON6], I'll leave it connected here in lecture room, I'll clean up here in lecture room, I'll leave it connected.
-The Russians working caraoke star, transcript processing, test script first.<n> transcript processing test script first, cell ties data preparation first, transcript processing test script first.
-[PERSON9] proposed that the segmenter should run separately from the script, so that the script should be tested and the segmenter should run separately.
-For the cell tiesion we do not want to run (byplan) for the locks for both before segmenter and after segmenter (not audible).
-The problem is this: I'm planning to open lot directed today itself, with or without transcript, I'm planning to open lot directed today itself.
-The most important thing is the alignment process, which is the most important part of the whole process of making the system work properly and the most important thing is the alignment process.
-There are 4 files we do not need any more but the longers chunks of supreme audit institutions like Belgian Belgian Belgian Belgian all these speeches so these are more hard files.
-Input files for this program.<n>Do you have input files for this program yet or have input files already?,<n>Do you have input files for this program yet?
-This is the main problem with [PERSON14] and [PERSON13] is that they don't know where the split chunks are.<n>
-The problem with this is that the two people who are working on the copy are not aware of the problems.<n>The problem is that the two people who are working on the copy are not aware of the problems.
-The most important path for evaluation is the Antrecorp academy and the Antrecorp short path.The academy and the Antrecorp short path are the most important paths for evaluation.
-The system number varies from sheet number 3 forced inputs to sheet number 3 forced inputs, the system number varies from sheet number 3 forced inputs to sheet number 3 forced inputs.
-Look at these transcripts I, you should simply - Not look at these transcripts, cause these transcripts are not audible to the participant, cause these transcripts are not audible transcripts.
-Polish transcripts are now separate from the file switch transcripts, as they are now separate from the file switch transcripts.The file switch transcripts are now separate from the transcripts.
-The parallel_talk> is a text-to-talk interface between two computers, the parallel_talk> and the parallel_talk> is a text-to-talk interface between two computers.
-So here is the list of files that are in the most recent version of [PERSON13] and [PERSON11] which is the current version of [PERSON12].
-Please put the path of the files that you are processing here, this will resolve the problems that you may have encountered with the file processing software that you are using.
-The problem with the subtitles is that they are not in the format that we need to have versioned, they are not in the format format that we need to have versioned.
-The Antrecorp - I'm also aware of the Antrecorp, I'm also aware of the Antrecorp, I'm also aware of the Antrecorp.
-This is the most stupid thing you can ever do with a text - It's totaly stupid thing it's multiline slash - It's totaly stupid thing it's multiline slash - It's totaly stupid thing it's multiline slash
-Check out the Antrecorp files, the depth, the cell ties, and the forced alignments and different types of cell ties.<n>Check out the Antrecorp files, the depth, the cell ties, the forced alignments and different types of cell ties.
-So here is the depth set for Antrecorp 2 WAVs and the depth set for Antrecorp 2 WAVs, So here is the depth set for Antrecorp 2 files and the depth set for Antrecorp 2 files.
-[PERSON forced alignment files on SLT test set depth set inputs in audible data set sheet,] So can you open sheet well in audible data set inputs in SLT test set sheet.
-On third sheet forced alignments, it's a good input for [PERSON14], it's the version one, it's important.
-If you chunk the WAV files, the files will be small enough to fit into a small folder, if you chunking them from the original WAV files.
-Now we need to review part of B3 to D16 Dutch WAV files from 16 kilohertz to 16 kilohertz (B3 to D16 Dutch WAV files).
-This is the most important part of the [PERSON14] project, which is the most important part of the [PERSON14] project.<n>
-In the academy we list the list of the paths there, the most important ones are the academy, the most important ones are the academy, the most important ones are the academy.
-This is the full path to the split file.The chunked version that does not have an ugly name.The full path to the split file does not have an ugly name.
-If you have done everything then do it tomorrow okay?,<n>If you have done everything then do it tomorrow okay?,<n>If you have done everything then do it tomorrow okay?
-This case is for the academy test set we have now for the academy test set we have now for the test set we have now for the academy test set.

-What level of alignment did you create?, what level of alignment did you create?, what level of alignment did you create?, what level of alignment did you create?
-The word level alignments itself is the main focus of the game.The word level alignments itself is the main focus of the game, the focus of the game.
-Now I can make Python script for all scripts - I can make Python script for all scripts - I can make Python script for all scripts - I can make Python script for all scripts -
-The corpus is the most important part of the speech, because it is the most important part of the speech, it is the most important part of the speech.
