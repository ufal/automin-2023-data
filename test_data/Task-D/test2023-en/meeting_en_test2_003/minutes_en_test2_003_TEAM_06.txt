` PERSON1 ' is a type of multi-source that we do n't have much progress with multi-source < q > one of the critics in the multi-source research also in the text domain danny cevallos : a multi-source is not a challenge because text are all already very disambiguate < q > cevallos : it 's possible that you 're right , and ah , is more ambiguous and therefore , ah < q > he says we need to have a separate call with you and [ PERSON1 ] , ah , so that we would like double check the exact plans bruce schneier says PERSON10 is n't as efficient asr < q > he says it 's wrong language chosen for the wrong chanel < q > schneier : it 's important to know if PERSON11 is n't connected to the call william bennett : we need to put this annotation into all the files , at the appropriate places and then they need to do the second round , which will be the same thing at the token level an alignment between the two terms of the word is thought to be good < q > this is because , it 's not so-sounding , but it 's actually a problem < q > it 's when we were going from german into england to english < q > but it does not have the problem here , but i think it still has the problem david frum : alignments are n't very good , but it has a meaning < q > frum : alignment files would be useful for a simple sentence < q > he says alignment files can be useful , but we need to fix that , he says maxing it with , with the , like proportional alignment , does n't make sense to me < q > she says it 's not correct if we are doing the alignment based thing , then we should follow the alignment and this like maxing cnn 's jarrett bellini is confused by the numbers in the german city of o < q > this is because o is located at 235 , because it is when o was emitted , he says < q > the difference is not the same , but i 'm doing the calculation right here the end of the world is like three characters proportionally from two , 0 , four and four zero ( PERSON8 ) < q > this is the first time you see this , according to PERSON8 ( PERSON4 ) oh , ( person ) ah , first time < q > i think it would make more sense to have this , to really based it on c a simple way to call it simple enough to call the simple calculation to something that is based on the number of characters < q > when it 's faster , there 's no doubt that it 's better than any other kind of paper-based list this is because it is proportional in the number of words < q > but it 's not like perfectly aligned to this , but the alignment view , and ` 7th das `` is n ' is perfectly aligned < q > it 's based on the word of , for example , is between each of the four the main question is , how come that it 's slower with more languages , like multiple , multiple replicas of your same workers , and each emitting , a different subset of languages < q > we should be able to launch rainbow worker from [ PERSON9 ] on our cluster ( PERSON9 ) , for example ` 7th PERSON1 ' will do a list of the two things to do is to , um , double check , the stages , and if they are part of the list uedin rainbow audience ( PERSON5 ) is the subject of uedin rainbow audiences < q > ah , ah , is working on the shortening and extending models < q > e-mail , e-mail and e-mail are a source of information , says ah the email was sent only when i was sitting at the court room < q > no actually the email should got send only when he was sitting PERSON5 is an indian guy who is interested in joining your group < q > one deadline is very soon . it 's a briefly so he should check it 's something like that ( PERSON2 ) , and he should email that he is interested author tommorow is trying to send a ORGANIZATION6 invite to the ORGANIZATION6 < q > ah , from ah , is a PROJECT2 , set automated so cnn 's ah has compiled a list of the top 10 list of ` unintelligible 's ' < q > the list includes the list 's list of list 's most famous list je ( o ) , a sick dial , has been working on the submissions at most in some , but they need to have three months of sitting , just like having it on their to do lists and then in the two weeks , they will give it < q > o : i 'm worried that the timing of sick dial is equally bad as the interspeech special session or worse o : i 'm definitely in favor of the later dead lines < q > o : it 's a rare thing that the test sets are updated < q > i think it is more likely for our minuting setup , o says steve rushkoff : when we 've saved some of their turtle funds or something like that , it was easy < q > he says we do not get into interspeech like a backup plan if you do n't get it ( o ) so , ah , so we can also run it as a sick dial thing < q > rushkoff : we do n't publish in [ PROJECT11 ] so we do n '' t publish in sick dial , but if someone manages to do it in time if the paper is worth publishing , it 's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event < q > ah , ah , if you manage to have your paper ready by the interspeech deadline , send it as an interspeech paper , and you will have it with interspeech
