-Ask people if they have any knowledge of spoken language translation research in Czech or German, they would like to share their experiences and their opinions.<n>The main project until 6th March is multisource spoken language translation research.
-Retrain the data to the models that would be used in the [PERSON11] model.<n>Retrain the data to the models that would be used in the [PERSON11] model.

-[PERSON9] would check out the control crews set up from his laptop connected to wired connection and evaluate the ASR quality with compression or without compression.
-The Monday seminar is a test set and we can do as uncompressed check word error rate and compressed pipeline and again check word error rate and let's see how it goes.
-[PERSON9m] to collaborate with the [PERSON9m] to evaluate the [PERSON9m] system, to evaluate the [PERSON9m] system.
-First of all I want to propose some ideas for the test set for evaluation of simultaneous translation of audio file and I want to propose some ideas for the test set.
-To evaluate the quality of various systems, we need to evaluate the reliability of various systems, the reliability of various systems, the reliability of various systems, the reliability of various systems, the reliability of various systems.
-If you have a device that could evaluate your system, you could set up a regular evaluation of your system.<n>A regular evaluation could set up your pipelines.
-Test our framework and intermediates papers so we can have meeting with [PERSON8], and test everything so we can have a meeting with [PERSON8], and test everything so we can have a meeting with [PERSON8], and test everything

-The most important thing is to find the best tool that is easy to use and produces good results in the evaluation process of the various tools, [PERSON7], [PERSON12], [PERSON7], [PERSON12]
-So we need to use different tool like PDF working for German language working for PDF working for German language working for German language working.
-To integrate the data sets from various sources, we use the data sets from various sources, the data sets from various sources, the data sets from various sources, the data sets from various sources,
-We are working on English to Czech languages, we are going to implement a back translation in the next week, we are working on English to Czech languages.
-The first occasion on which we could use these systems is on Wednesday already - There are multiple occasions on which we could use these systems.<n>The second occasion on which we could use these systems is on Wednesday already - There are multiple occasions on which we could use these systems.
