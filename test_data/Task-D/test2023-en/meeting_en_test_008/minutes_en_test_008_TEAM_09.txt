<transcript>
(PERSON5): Ehm, thank you.You are preparing the link into the-
(PERSON8): Ye, Ye, Ye
No, no, I'm just aligning that link of the web interface, which is already there one in the corrector-
(PERSON5): So [PERSON7] we have discussed with [PERSON8] your negotation.[PERSON8] prepaired some crieteria, so the guidelines for the evaluation.But they are not fully ready yet so as far as they will be ready she will share it with us.(PERSON7): Also are there any links to them for the menu of the evaluation thing?(PERSON7): Are there any links to that of the-
Ye, for the manual evaluation thing.(PERSON5): [PERSON8] is searching for some reference to the evaluation.(PERSON8): Ye, I am searching I I did hadn't half of the copy of it.And I am finding-
(PERSON5): Okay
And I had so many papers to find.(PERSON5): Okay, Take your time and maybe as you have it just paste it please.(PERSON8): Ye I will, I'm just finding it.(PERSON5): So I actually wanted to talk to [PERSON2] today and he planned to join us.But i don't see him up at the moment.So [PERSON7] did you manage to upload-
ayeye.(PERSON7): I did with you [PERSON5] for like I have to collect the minutes so-
I don't understand this upload thing.(PERSON5): Well not upload, so did you do something with that already?(PERSON7): Ye, ye, so, the thing is like I'm starting the I'm starting the web that how to croll those minutes.And how to like find what is actually there in the [ORGANIZATION3] corpus and how we do that link with the web.And I'm also in touch with [PERSON3] <unintelligible> because he has done-
(PERSON5): Ehm, Ehm, okay.(PERSON7): So I just connected with him and maybe will be skipping meeting later this week.(PERSON5): With [PERSON3]?(PERSON7): Ye, ye, with the [PERSON3], ye.(PERSON5): Okay, so this is clear.What should we disscus today else-
What else should we?(PERSON7): I just want to know a few things from you regarding that europarl website maybe you can guide me.(PERSON5): Yea.(PERSON7): Okay, so from the source like from the transcripts that we have.(PERSON5): Yes, so for each transcript in europarl you can find the minutes.Can you just share the screen-
(PERSON5): Ye, if you see the gender.I will copy paste it to the today's gender.So that you can also open it.I will show the screen.(PERSON7): Ye
(PERSON5): Can you see it?(PERSON7): Ye, Ye.(PERSON5): Ye, so if I follow the link I may open this search for minutes, here's minutes, and here's a search.And the name could be from if you go to the data, europarl data.It says the name European environmental aconomic accounts (debate).(PERSON7): So it might be in the other range, so the [ORGANIZATION3] script is from 9 to 14 I guess.That must be in other range.(PERSON5): No I found it, but yes.(PERSON5): Yes, this is the one, there were certain additional to that.Yes, so you can see ah, six six 2011, this is six six 2011.And here you can see that this name corresponds to chapter eight year, sixteen.And this is here, you just click on it.(PERSON7): So once you open it we get the minutes?(PERSON5): Yes, now, here are the minutes.(PERSON5): Yes.I don't know if this website has gotten index of the minutes just like it had for the transcripts.(PERSON5): Which index, the index does not correspond.Because the indexes here, these ones correspond to the court was not the whole [ORGANIZATION3].And here we are so on the web we are within [ORGANIZATION3] website.And here here we are not on within the [ORGANIZATION3] website.We are within the corpus created for machine translation purposes.(PERSON7): Ye, ye, ye.So I think this corresponds with manually verified this corresponds cause this one is a-
(PERSON5): Yes, yes.(PERSON7): So chapter that is 16 is also like 16.(PERSON5): Yes, yes.(PERSON8): [PERSON5], I have linked the reference in the agenda.They has on the intereface maybe you can just have a look.Oh, no sorry is my-
(PERSON8): There are two links, one to different links.(PERSON8):Ye this is some paper, they have shown the interface.So you want to just see that what they are following like the based or is it some kind of the-
So they have shown us a snapshot of the interface which they have done for the annotation tool
(PERSON5): But what should I do with that?How they have built this tool for annotation of the valuation.(PERSON7): This is from [ORGANIZATION2], oh, interesting.(PERSON5): This [PERSON6] is a colleague.(PERSON7): Oh, okay.(PERSON8): Yea at the end, at the end of-
(PERSON5): Ehm, ehm.(PERSON8): There were some interface and the example of it can be shown.(PERSON8): You have opened Fact-based Content Weighting?(PERSON5): Fact-based.(PERSON8): Okay, so in the fact-based the figure number ehm.After the in the after the references you can find that.(PERSON8): Number two-
(PERSON5): Yes, this one says looking at now.(PERSON8): Yea, they have an interface.But this paper does not have their base interface as a meeting.The interface we haven't shown it-
(PERSON5): Okay
(PERSON8): It is the based our it is not by base.We haven't mentioned it.But the other paper they it is it is ehm.(PERSON8): Are you sharing your screen?(PERSON8): Ehm, yea.(PERSON5): There is anything, where is it?.(PERSON8): Yea, so I wanted to show you that here itself in on page number-
(PERSON5): This blue one, yes?(PERSON8): Ye, at the bottom implementation details.They have just it is not shown the transcript and the summarisation.But this is just a web application which they have shown the snapshot.But in the implementation details they have mentioned the entire thing.That where they have this summary and transcript which they have put in the web application.(PERSON5): Now you speaking about which figure.(PERSON8): So I'm this is the interface which can be seen in web application.But they have the for the ratings they have this web application.(PERSON5): So you propose to make something like that?(PERSON8): So I and if you see to like after the references can you just go after the references?After the references theres a before this yea before this 
There is a section.B section and B.B section.So this practical task, ye.Here, ye this page.Scroll down a little [PERSON5], ye.If you can see here they have this Evaluation Session Collection.Maybe you can see the previous page as well it-
(PERSON5): Ehm.(PERSON8): Yea so if you can see the Trap Task.And how good is the summary
So they have this entire web interface.So we will disscussing whether we should have web interface or something.So this is a paper from 2020 September.So I told you that what i reviewed from the various papers regarding the evaluation.So regarding evaluation matrix some of them have the their interface as a fact-base.And some of them does not have.So I just wanted to show you how how what kind of people-
What kind of manually valuation people are performing for the summarisation systems.And based on the web-
There are annotators are asking by scene board the transcript and the summary.(PERSON5): Well, fine.I'm totally happy with that.So if you create something like this.This is very good.(PERSON8): Okay, so I will form this airdraft and send you and please finalize.(PERSON8): So I just wanted to confirm that is the web base good for us or something else is is.(PERSON5): No, we are not expecting any specific.I think you just come up with what you consider to be the best.Taking to any-
(PERSON8): Ehm.(PERSON5): In the state of <unintelligible> or what is.(PERSON8): Yea, even I wanted to ask the contented would it would it be good for shared task.Because I think the annotators will be able to evaluate it in in a better way.(PERSON7): I want to understand the work for first.(PERSON7): Like <unintelligible> beginning.(PERSON8): So, what I proposed is that we have the transcript and the reference in the interface.So the annotators do not have to compute each and-
Because there are so many minutes and the ones which are generated.So building an interface for it would be a good thing.(PERSON7): So I just want to understand that supposed we have the interface.And we will have the questions for while which the annotators would.So do you want to do it for all the data.(PERSON8): Yea, yea, yea.(PERSON7): You mean the train test where you just share everything, yes?(PERSON8): Yea, because the main purpose to build this manually evaluation.So-
(PERSON7): Yea, I would like to understand how.(PERSON8): So how will we evaluate the generated minutes by the participants.(PERSON7): So that's what I'm asking.So thank you for the prooving details we already <unintelligible> for the testing data.That's what I'm asking that what do we want for shared task.Or you want it for both?(PERSON7): I'm still not sure how the manual evaluation work mutely.I don't unders-
We have a very <unintelligible> set of questions here.So that is that that is really like depending on a writer.This is a good summary and this is a bad summary.(PERSON8): Ye, ye, we can do that.Maybe I will I will send you a both draft.And that's what I was asking that building an interface would be a good thing.Because interface would a better thing.Just building the guidelines and heading forward to annotators.I don't think that would be a good thing but.Building an interface and giving them the link of the interface.That could be better-
(PERSON7): Ye, interface is fine.Interface is fine.I'm absolutely okay with the interface.Rating scale that we have-
(PERSON8): Ye, ye, this is what.Yea, hmm.(PERSON7): That is that is.What are the rates to each of the questions.And then we have very cris example that what is a good summary and what is a bad summary.So, once we haven't have that.(PERSON8): Ye, that's that's that's what [PERSON5] and I discussed that for the drafting of each should be finalized.And then we can-
(PERSON7): The drafting yes, the drafting is very much boring.The drafting from our link is very much boring.When you start the manual evaluation question there or maybe is that you are suggesting.(PERSON8): So let me share the draft maybe.And then you will all please have a look on that.So I was reading the paper how to actually add interface some constant values.I'm reading the papers because I have some more measures into it.Which people were considered a lot in their summarization systems.So actually multiplying them with the constant value is is thing to be decided.Okay so I will send the-
(PERSON7): So as I underst-
Understand so the coherence with the read ability and all these scores.So that would be the human judgement, right?So humans are going to read on the cautions one to five.(PERSON7): Ye, ye that-
(PERSON5): I would just like to add.I'd like to add that it would be that it is very hard work to make these evoluations.It will so it will take much very much time and very much effort.(PERSON8): So yea, but [PERSON5] I think we need this in another way also.Because to compare our automatic matrix.(PERSON5): Yea, ye definitely.But-
(PERSON8): Yea, so that we know that.(PERSON5): And anyways it has a sense to speak about it after we see your <unintelligible> criterias.(PERSON8): Yes, yes.So should I make a different-
(PERSON7): [PERSON8].Ye [PERSON8] please also while you put your criterias please also evaluate two minutes-
(PERSON8): Hmm, okay
(PERSON7): Okay, so that we can have the same set up of what good and bad minute looks like.(PERSON8): Hmm, okay.So [PERSON5] can you can you please do me a favor.(PERSON5): So you want two different-
(PERSON8): Yea two small small minutes so that I can evaluate based on the measures.[PERSON5], do you have any example how my cautions do work on a minutes.(PERSON5): Yes I will-
(PERSON7): Maybe we all can-
(PERSON8): This is a good thing-
(PERSON7): Maybe we all can do like.We all can annotate a single minute and then we will see based on [PERSON8]'s criteria.Or audience criteria with judgement we all <unintelligible>-
(PERSON5): So we all three we will judge not draft the minutes.We all of us will get-
(PERSON7): Judge, ye.(PERSON5): Yes, everybody-
(PERSON7): With the transcript, ye.(PERSON5): Yea, we will get transcripts and two different minutes.(PERSON7): Okay, yes.(PERSON5): I will prepare it, I will prepare it.(PERSON8): Yea, so it is it is I think a good idea so we can easily finalize the draft
(PERSON7): Yes.(PERSON8): Yea, because anyway, if we do have annotators.(PERSON7): So [PERSON5] I would like to ask like for currently then we are not going ahead with the alignment thing, right?(PERSON5): Say it once more, please.(PERSON7): So currently we are not going ahead with the alignment thing.(PERSON5): No, if you don't know anything me neither.Yea, I think for the first shared task I would like absolutely keep everything as simple as possible.And then once we have experience on that.We go ahead with some innovations or novelties based on that.And also the response from the participants.(PERSON5): Yea, well I.(PERSON7): So I would like to ask [PERSON8].[PERSON8], if you have any progress on the automatic part?(PERSON8): No, no I don't have.Yea, I I do not have any progress with the new thing.What are the pr-
(PERSON8): So some eval and the one was the another paper <unintelligible>.(PERSON7): Okay, so can we just <unintelligible> about that.(PERSON8): Hmm, about the papers which?(PERSON7): Yea, no, I thought the matrix that you that you did.(PERSON8): Okay, so I maybe link the papers which I implemented.(PERSON7): Yea, okay.(PERSON8): Yea, so I did try with our data.That is one thing which I'm insure towards small portion.So this is only a new thing which I'm doing.I'm doing it with our data and not the AMI and the ICSA corpora.So-
(PERSON7): So on our paper do you have any figures that how the matrix work.(PERSON8): So I haven't made my matrix until now.It's really something-
(PERSON7): Yea, sorry, yea I mean.(PERSON7): Okay, so do you have any insights that how those work?(PERSON8): Umm, so how do they work?Maybe you can refer to the link.(PERSON8): So I think you also might have done the papers I think.There are only three four papers on on this-
(PERSON7): Evaluation.(PERSON8): Yea, evaluation.One is some eval so you also might also have come across that.Did you?(PERSON7): Yea, ye, ye.(PERSON5): I have sent you the meeting with one transcript and two short minutes.(PERSON8): Okay, thank you so much [PERSON5].(PERSON7): And when [PERSON8] need to share the evaluation criteria and we would all would annotate.(PERSON8): Yes, yes, sure.(PERSON7): Yea, so I think if we can have like the europarl data with the transcript and the minutes align.We we need not to worry about the data sights because if we-
(PERSON5): Yes.If we are able to align minutes and transcripts automatically what.Then this is not a big difference to make much more data from all the years.So I dont know if it makes sense but probably technically it will no-
These are already exemples these transcripts.And the minutes are also available and if they are-
Even automatically extractable it may have sense to extract all the meetings that are available.So you mean the europarl-
Okay, okay so you mean that-
(PERSON5): So not just this 6 years but all the years.(PERSON7): Yea, but let us draft for the 6 years.So one thing [PERSON5] so you buy alignment so I'm like getting a little bit confused.But alignment you mean that within a folder for one meeting.You have the ASR and the minute, right.(PERSON5): Yes, so to find for each meeting-
(PERSON7): Okay, because for-
(PERSON5): Each transcript finds its minutes this is the-
(PERSON7): The minutes, yes.Because I did know we were talking about alignments between the transcript and-
(PERSON5): No, no, it's different.(PERSON7): So yea, so let's not be 
(PERSON5): Ye, ye it seems bigger but I meant just finding minutes for each transcript.(PERSON7): Right, right so okay.(PERSON5): Okay, somehow you didn't push us away today so they granted us woth extra time.(PERSON7): No it's about to end in two minutes.(PERSON5): Ah, okay, aha well fine.(PERSON7): Yea I think yea.And [PERSON8] and please also send the automatic evaluation that the paper of <unintelligible> want to.And we can also like discuss it offline.(PERSON8): Yes, yes, sure, I am just linking them.So I have them on the cluster also.The implementation I've done on <unintelligible>.I will I will link them in five minutes I think just opening the-
(PERSON7): Yea, sure, sure, okay.(PERSON5): Okay, thank you.(PERSON7): Okay, thank you, bye, bye.(PERSON8): Okay, goodbye.
