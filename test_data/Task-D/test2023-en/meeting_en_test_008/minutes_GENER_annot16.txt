Name of the meeting: Discussion about the best way to achieve good transcript and minutes results.
Meeting creator: [PERSON5]


-How will the interface look like.
--Somebody with the user rating and the user queries needed.
--Annotators get set of cautions that they answer to see if the summarisation and cautions are useful.
---They are asked by scene board.
--Regarding evaluation matrix some of the papers have the interface as a fact-based.
--The idea is to build the interface that shows transcript and summarisation.
---Annotators give the rating to it.
---The awaited score will be calculated.
---Annotators do not have to compute each equation.


-Detailed objectives of this meeting
--Uploading the [ORGANIZATION3] sources and making the alignment.
--Preapairing criterias for the evaluation.
--Implemented summarisation is done with their own data.
--They will not draft the minutes but judge them to finalize the draft.
--It is not a problem to make more data from all the years if they are able to align minutes and transcripts automatically.
--Each transcript finds its minutes.
--They will get transcript and two different minutes and judge it to finalize the draft.



-Conclusion: findings, concerns, ideas, decisions
--Web base interface for manual evaluation could be better for annotators.
--Building an interface would be a good idea.
--Giving the annotators link of the interface to evaluate it would be better than building guidelines.
---First they need a rating scale to be sure about that.
---Drafting should be finalized.
--Humans are supposed to read the cautions and the equation will be computered automatically: it takes much more time for annotators, so not the best suggestion.
--They can add some constant values to the interface.
