i was also hoping to see PERSON6 but yeah that's not the case. i would like primarily to ask PERSON16 and PERSON3uh to debag what was the problem yesterday. so i mean no uh for slowness there is just one explanation. please get in touch with PERSON9 and try to debug the that again. so you can probably replay that and see what we can do about the recognition quality. and so i have to address this problem where the files were too big so i could not get uploaded to PROJECT3. now i am looking so i can just upload it as a link file or something like that.
