Uh, [PERSON7] you are trying to, uh, recover from your past, uh, missed sessions uh, uh, by coming twice.Uh, I would like primarily to ask [PERSON16] and [PERSON3],uh, to debag, what was the problem yesterday.Uh, and, um-
<?another_language?>
Uh, so it didn't-.Uh, so, uh, uh, [PERSON16] would you have any, uh, any explanation, uh, for, the 
slowness?<unintelligible>
(PERSON13) So, uh, coul-.Please get in touch with [PERSON9], uh and, uh, try to debug the, that again.(PERSON16) Uh, so today I'm supposed to.And so I have to address this problem where the files were too big, so I could not get uploaded to [PROJECT3].(PERSON16) Now, I am looking so i can just upload it as a link file or something like that.(PERSON13) Yeah, yeah, please do.(PERSON13) Mhm
(PERSON16) So I, I was doing it it now, just before this call.(PERSON13) Yeah, uh, uh, also please be in touch with [PERSON4].So, uh, he has set up [PROJECT4] by now.(PERSON13) So, uh, that is uh, uh, I, don't think that is needed.And yes, doing something with [PROJECT4] is useful in the long term, but it is better if people who already have that experience do it now.I mean you can't download it or <unintelligible>
(PERSON13) Uh, well-.(PERSON16) Also there are videos, so that even the transcript, you can't get it it unless you apply for it.And then-
(PERSON13) Uh, so is, he is that the full [PROJECT13] archive?So what it should at least explain to him that there is a clear distinction between the [PROJECT13] Archive, which are the interviews with the survivors of World War II of of the Holocaust.So it's like, uh, the historical evidence, the recordings, and then the historical papers and 
presentations by historicians.And we are interested in the latter in the, in the historians talking about that.(PERSON13) So, in short, he should also scan the web pages of the people.So it is like breath for scan for the data so that he has whatever he can, even if he is still waiting for some resource.(PERSON16) Yes, I'll do that.Yeah, unfortunately, I'm still horribly struggling with the [ORGANIZATION6], uh, [ORGANIZATION6] demo papers which are due tomorrow.Not not too late, because, like, I will be busy the the whole Saturday, and I have to go early to bed on on Friday.And, uh, I have now, uh, started worrying about the calculations of a number of things.(PERSON13) So, uh, the mind concern now was the alignment based thing.And whether it actually does the max, uh, or, uh, something, like that.Okay, so please, please have a look at the [PROJECT2], the [PROJECT2] environment in the [PROJECT7] paper.And in the [PROJECT2] environment I explained in two cases, German to English and English to German what is probably going to-.And like after we finish with the general call, if you're still available, if you do not have to rush for your dentist, uh, then we can discuss this.Just I will see all of your things, and I will check the code, and we will answer everything in detail in one email to you.(PERSON13) Yeah, okay.Well, if you have time in the afternoon for a call.(PERSON13) That would probably be faster, but anyway write the answers, uh, down.And, uh, I would like to ask [PERSON15], because he-
(PERSON6) [PERSON13], sorry.[PERSON2], [PERSON2] is actually still, is still here so  and he works.(PERSON13) Okay, okay, that's good.(PERSON13) <laugh>
So, could you.Uh,  [PROJECT12] multilingual life subtitling.They say that we have in a little impact, or they, they don't like it.So if you could look at this, this would be extremely, uh, extremely useful.Uh, let us move on to, yeah, uh, the, uh, the idea that I have, uh, discussed yesterday, but [ORGANIZATION2] is not too keen on that.So the [PROJECT14] quality is very bad for all, uh, remotely handled sessions, and especially if people are wearing face masks.And, uh, we pass all our training data through [PROJECT8] and other systems in an automated way so that we get the data distorted, uh, um, in the same way as these platforms distort it, and also that we will use a frequency filter to cut down on the hate, on the like high frequencies.And then we would, uh, either ourselves retrain that, or we would also like happily shift, send the data to [ORGANIZATION2] and ask them to train their system, because their system is is online and, uh, fully integrated.That it will be some scripting of of user interface in, uh, in [PROJECT15], and and uh-.Like it is not too bad if you, uh, if you would run it in four [PROJECT8] sessions in parallel.Uh, then in a week, you would get like 600 hours.There there would be some extra overhead, uh, um, for for the restart or whatever, but it but it should work.Ah, so is anybody, uh, curious about learning how to automate, uh, x Windows and, uh and or perhaps windows that can be done also with Windows.(PERSON13) Yeah, so so [PERSON16], you should work on the evaluations first and fore-
So for you, this is a lower priority I think.(PERSON13) [ORGANIZATION8] demo yeah.(PERSON15) I'm continuing with data preparation of [ORGANIZATION5] corpus.And right now, I'm running the first alignments on on the manually revised the Dev test.And then I want to rerun the alignments of source and targets of of the interpreters and do some analysis on them.And, oh, has he started to write the, uh, the summary of-
(PERSON15) Uh, oh, I do not have any update.(PERSON15)  In January.If you have some long term processing of [ORGANIZATION5] that is like where computation time is needed, then start it.But otherwise I suggest that you, uh, move or give more priority to the the write up of the experiment with [PERSON5], because he will also be struggling.(PERSON13) Thanks [PERSON7] for the suggestion, uh, to just to use [PROJECT10] audio codec.Could you get in touch with [PERSON8] and process all the files that [PERSON8] has for, um, uh,
English, uh, training data we need.We need Czech-
(PERSON7) Yeah, sure I, I can get in touch with him.Uh, whereas we need English, uh, in, like on the 25th like in 10 days.But if we process the data that that we have for English, for them.Uh, they could give it a try.And the performance was so bad that we really need to like go into this and and try to improve, uh, that.So then, [PERSON7], uh since I've already asked you, uh, please summarize for everybody.What is your status with the, uh, with the, uh, pipeline preparation, or pipeline configuration tool.It consists of a multiple parts, like some [PROJECT14], um, some machine translation and, uh, some online, uh, subtitles.And for, uh, for every event, we need to, uh, make this pipeline in a different way.And ,uh, I'm writing a tool that, uh, will allow an operator to define the, uh, the part, of the pipeline and how they are connected.And the tool will make a <unintelligible> script, that will make sure that everything is corrected as it was specified.And there should also be some support for a docker, uh, and part of the pipeline that are, that are in docker.Uh, that the pipeline will be defined in terms of like abstract graph, in a way, uh, and, then
it will be compiled to a batch launcher, or a docker launcher, or or evaluation launcher.And the evaluation launcher that would run the pipeline through the [PROJECT12] test set, uh, with [PROJECT7].That we would know, uh, which of the parts of the pipeline are, performing badly in 
terms of translation quality.Uh, like a test of availability.So that's another thing that, that [PERSON7], uh, uh, uh, should <unintelligible> on-.if you could put this on, uh, on the to do list or on the enhancement options, that would also be very useful.Uh, and another thing would be, uh, like live debugging, uh, of a of a pipeline such a speed of, uh, of that.And, uh, yes, and uh, so, and then the second item you have in your list [PERSON7].So, uh, next Friday, uh, like, next week somewhere there there is going to be a conference about [PROJECT13] and we are going to provide life subtitles and transcription.And because we will have some non native English speakers in there, so we will need to get some feedback, from the people that are using our subtitles.So we can, uh, see a moments like, uh, where it was working and moments where it was not working.So, uh, it would be best, if you could get in touch with [PERSON18].Because I've asked [PERSON18] to like handle the soft, uh, soft things with the participants and also with the organisers.And, uh, um, you and [PERSON18] should prepare very simple instructions that the participants could follow.And it would be both for just giving them access to the subtitles and uh, separately-.If the organisers say, that it is it is reasonable to ask such a thing, to get feedback from the uh, from the participants.You and [PERSON18], you and [PERSON18] if you could, uh, um, could come up with the strategy, like the set of things that we want to offer and that we want to ask for.It's on the twenty fifth on January.So there is a week and a day.So, uh, and [PERSON15], if you could share with, uh, [PERSON7] your simple feedback clicking page.Given the quality is pretty bad, uh, we don't want to like, uh, ask the people, to tell us, it's bad, it's bad, it is bad, it's bad, like, it's-
We, we need some, uh, some more useful information.Uh, and if our outputs are so bad as they were yesterday, then there is actually no point in collecting the feedback at all.So hopefully we'll we'll have better working system on, uh, on the twenty fifth.Everything, because when you finish, I want to describe what what <unintelligible>
(PERSON13) Okay that is, good.So, the, uh, we have [PERSON3] so [PERSON3], please tell us what is your status.(PERSON3) <other_noise>
Sorry.(PERSON13) <laugh>
Yeah.(PERSON13) So please do the, uh, uh, as as I wrote in the email, uh, do the files.(PERSON13) And also, uh, if Vicky, uh, and and [PERSON16] find out some [PROJECT13] data in the public domain, please add them to the public part of [PROJECT12] test set.I have already provided, uh, [PROJECT13], one [PROJECT13] interview in the confidential part.[PERSON16], please do evaluate the, uh, the, systems, uh, on everything.So that the next week same time, uh, you can present the summary, uh, of which, uh, [PROJECT14] systems and which [PROJECT1] systems we have at hand.(PERSON13) So so you you two, please make sure that we evaluate everything on everything, and we, uh, can choose the the best set up.In the last <unintelligible> seminar, uh, the, pipe was, stuck at a point.(PERSON3) Okay, and, I, I will also send you another [PROJECT3] repository, which we have that,
uh, these presenters would be-.To make some [PERSON17]es in their <unintelligible> editor and to the manual, or a revision of more more conveniently.(PERSON13) Yeah, so [PERSON1] is the last person, uh, mentioned in the uh, uh, uh, in in the in the report.Uh, and he successfully developed a shortening [PROJECT1], um, English to Czech.So there is something which makes the output 80 percent of the input length and the bleu score, yes, is lower, but just the shorter outflow the lower the bleu score.And this is also something that I really want [PERSON16] to include, uh, uh, in the evaluations.So make it a new evaluation campaign, uh, uh, in the [PROJECT12] test set evaluations.And put the multiple [PROJECT1] systems, including the shortening [PROJECT1] systems based on what [PERSON1] provides, so that we can look at the outputs.I'm saying that it has to be committed to the [PROJECT12] test set evaluations, because the bleu scores will be definitely lower.Uh, so, uh, to be evaluated in, uh, new, uh, [PROJECT12] test set evaluations, uh, campaign.Uh, the output needs to be manually, uh, validated or, uh, or evaluated bleus are bound to be lower.Okay, uh, so I think that is probably everything right?Oh, actually, [PERSON8] [PERSON8] [PERSON8] you're here and you did not say anything.<laugh>
(PERSON8) Yes, I'm I'm working on the chopped, uh, training.For example, for English, and I 'm now working on English and, um, I cut the recordings, uh, to words.And there is that we can create more robust [PROJECT14]  that is that is not for refitting any 
speaker we can read, because we can um.We can, uh, for example, alter the distribution of speakers, or and uh, the second, uh, important, uh, gain that may be from this method is that the end to end [PROJECT14] models, um, are creating implicit language models within.And because the are the corpora, the corpora, um, the speech corpora have limited, uh,  ss- text then-.Uh, and if we create, uh, if if we use another text like from-.For for, for example, uh, some, some ,uh, some pure uh textual, uh, corpora that we can, uh, we can train on more, um, more texts or so.(PERSON8) Well, uh, I'm able to generate.Uh, now I'm str- struggling to optimize the the pipeline, because, uh, I, I've  I tried to plug it in the standard training pipeline, but it was too slow.And, um, and, uh, the problem is with, uh, the big corpora the be the big textural corpora  like Czech.If I want to create a, uh, like for for the [PROJECT11] speech, uh, text, uh, I'm doing there is so many such manner that.Um, I, I just , uh, create all the recordings for the all, all sentences in the corpus.And, uh, I have, uh, a job running on the cluster that is, uh, constantly, uh, rewriting, uh, new versions of, of, each, text, and, uh, it, is, it.(PERSON8) So in this way we are sure that each recording is, uh, seen by the, by the, uh, neural network only once.But, uh, the problem is with Czech, because, uh, the [PROJECT11] speech for example has a 
, uh, less than three hundred thousands texts.And, uh, common with the, [PERSON17] has like fifty or millions of recordings.(PERSON13) So-
But can you do it like in a rolling buffer on the disks so that you would actually be training over whatever, let's say-.(PERSON13) <unintelligible>
(PERSON13) I thought so, I thought, so, but, uh, I need to-.Uh, the the training pipeline on, that, private data stood loader within the [PROJECT9], uh framework is a black box and it is quite complicated.So, uh, I need to, uh somehow find how it works.And, uh, so I either I have some, uh, precise order, of, of, of, the elements.But, uh, I'm not sure I should be paid from [PERSON19]'s [PROJECT5] tool.Uh, but, uh, this should be discussed with [PERSON19] as well, because I'm not sure if she would um, uh, if her [PROJECT5] will be active now, uh, when she is on maternity leave.So she is giving a talk, uh, this afternoon, somewhere a remote one, uh, but after that, she, she would be hopefully available for to say, what is the status with the [PROJECT5].(PERSON13) I would I would use the same number, the same amount from the two [PROJECT5]s.
(PERSON8) Okay.And now I would like to talk to uh, uh, [PERSON6] and of course [PERSON2].Thanks everybody, and let us just see, eh, each other again with, uh, the latest, uh, next, next Thursday.And yeah, ah, I I think even in the at the beginning, we decided first to calculate C without any alignment.<unintelligible>
(PERSON13) Uh, yes, but this is not the same as what I'm asking for.Uh, and open the overleaf so it will take a while, sorry.Yep, so what I'm illustrating is the, uh, German and English, uh, where the German verb is split into two parts.And the second part is the content bearing, and ,uh, would get very likely aligned to this, uh, to the late part of the German verb would get aligned to the English word.Uh, the uh problem I see there is, uh, that uh, the alignment information between set and "gezacht" would bring the early time stamp of the "said" to the late part.Given the, uh, current max, uh, and [PROJECT11], uh, uh, there it would actually be okay.Due, uh, uh, uh because the, uh, the proportional position of "gezacht" is at the end of the segment.The German sentence will say "Ich habe" and then something very long here, and something vey long and "gezacht"
So the "gezacht" appears as late as 1500.Who, whi- which are more more or less monotonically aligned to the to the English.And unfortunately, if the [PROJECT1] system decides to obey the standard English grammar, it will cash these words.And it will wait with them only until it has guessed the verb, and then it would emit 
all the words at once.(PERSON6) <unintelligible>
(PERSON13) So, so proportionately-.So the proportion or alignment directly values will all require these words to be emitted, like it they would, it would expect these words to be emitted sooner than a previous word.My proposal is to, uh, maximize not only with the value from the proportional alignment as you are doing at the moment.(PERSON13) I'm thinking, so I'll I'll write the paper as if we are doing this already.(PERSON6) Yes, it's simple.(PERSON13) Uh, my question on [PERSON2] and you is now, if we if you are able to, uh, come up with an example so that we would actually replace the.Ah, in the pictures, these pictures are okay, but, uh, if we were able to illustrate this, uh, 
this alignment, it, would be perhaps even better.So if you could search for a similar simple sentence, uh, that, that, has, this, uh, 
alignment, uh, that that would be useful.If we if we are doing the alignment based thing, then we should follow the alignment and this like maxing, uh, uh, of the linear order progress of the maximisation.Because for example, the only acceptable reason the translator didn't  for example write this other word is waiting for this one.(PERSON6) After that, it should <unintelligible> both of them together, if shouldn't wait and then-
(PERSON13) Yes, yes exactly, yes.(PERSON6) So I think-
If, if, if it's a reason it should come up all in one line.(PERSON13) Yeah, the the evaluation would be different if we were producing a spoken output.So there there is a a recent paper.So depending on how much input they have in the pipeline, they are [PERSON17]ing the speed.That is a different model, uh, uh, at the output.So, [PERSON2], if if you could look for examples like the one in the [PROJECT2] case, that would be great.I would like delay that I I think that has a lower, uh, priority.And then I also had the questions for the, um,-
(PERSON6) <unintelligible>
(PERSON13) Yeah, so there I I 'm not sure if I actually wrote the questions down.So, I'll [PROJECT8] the picture here.So, it's it's okay in the simply like calculation that O is located at 235, because, that is when O was emitted.I've done the, uh, uh, the differences between each pair of, um, uh, words, and the differences are not the same.But if you want a can, again, do a calculation very clearly again, because I have not rechecked this.If  I'm doing the calculation right.(PERSON13) Yes, so so please have a look at it.That we, uh, simply equidistantly split this time, uh, into the words based on their length.The formula should be like, what is the value for the word "Ein" or the eath word, uh, uh,  in the table T. 
So how do we arrive at this three o four.And it should be just the proportion of the characters in "Oh das ist" 
And then I don't know whether you do include or do not include design "ein" in the total number of characters from.So the there should be just a number of characters, and the time stamp of O and the time stamp of T-shirt.It should be based on only C.
(PERSON13) Mhm.(PERSON13) It is not on C. There is two, 0,  four, and not two, three, five.(PERSON6) Ah, first time you see the 0, the first time you see this,.To really based it on C and have this, uh, h, and put here at the end of the world.So what i would suggest is, really base it on only C.
So two, 0, four and four four zero.Okay, I will I will check this very carefully and will answer you in email if it is something else.(PERSON13) Based on characters at the end time of ,uh, of the word.And based only on those time stamps in C.
Just can I ask if, [PERSON2], if you follow, I-.(PERSON6) You can answer me in Persian, it is okay, [PERSON2].(PERSON13) <laugh>
58:49 
(PERSON2) <?another_language?>
59:44 
(PERSON6) Okay, so.(PERSON2) <?another_language?>
(PERSON6) <unintelligible>
It considers these partial words.For example if it is seventh, for example if it is fifth word it calculated it.Sorry, sorry, the first time the word reaches in the C-.<laugh>
Uh, so so what you think if we, uh, if we really [PERSON17]ed the simple calculation to 
something which is based only on the C segment and the number of characters?.Like if you have, uh,1986, uh, then that would be four characters in the transcript, and then very long, uh, time span.(PERSON13) Okay, yeah, well, let's keep the paper as it is,
Like, let's not add any further things.But that's the alignment view, and "das" is not like perfectly aligned to, uh, to this, uh if you look at it, proportionately.Because there are seven words in German and six in English.(PERSON6) But, but is is mainly for when we, for example, we do not have any alignment information.First ot finds the place, for example, is between the word of, for example, the first and the second word.(PERSON6) For this one, for sure today, we will finish it after this [PERSON17]e, because it is very easy.Uh, that would be, uh, better, uh, there will be, uh, one that would show the alignment,
(PERSON6) Just one more thing [PERSON13].If you could repeat one comment just now in the <unintelligible>
You said, you will, you will fix it yourself, or I will fix or I should fix it?(PERSON2) [PERSON13], please could you add, add acc-, my [PROJECT3] account to the [PROJECT12] test set and the <unintelligible>?I'm surprised if you still do not have that access
(PERSON6) That's a good news [PERSON13].(PERSON2) Yes, Zarivar.(PERSON6) And also, on-
On, uh, maybe on [PROJECT6] also, so I can do that.(PERSON13) I will do also [PROJECT12] evaluation so you can see the outputs.And after all of this, I will send you an email, because I think I, maybe I might be not available in January to the first of February.And also, he is waiting for some feedback from other people for, uh, this censorship or something like that in their pipeline.Uh, push, push the people to do the job, and also try to integrate it yourself.(PERSON6) It is it is the name of a lake, this Zarivar.So actually, it just occurred to me that I'll probably also add you simply to [ORGANIZATION9] teams.(PERSON6) Yeah, maybe you can add me there too if I'm not.Ah, so, uh, please like get in touch with [PERSON16] and [PERSON7] and try to integrate the profanity filtering yourselves.So try to get the pipeline running for yourself and try to put it in there, because [PERSON16] is busy.(PERSON6) Okay, so I'm rushing to my dentist.
