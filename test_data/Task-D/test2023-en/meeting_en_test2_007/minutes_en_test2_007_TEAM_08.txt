Uh, [PERSON7] you are trying to, uh, recover from your past, uh, missed sessions uh, uh, by coming twice. Uh, I would like primarily to ask [PERSON16] and [PERSON3],uh, to debag, what was the problem yesterday. So I mean, no, uh, uh, for slowness there is just one explanation. And that is, uh, I need to be logged into, one, of, the machines. And otherwise, what is your, uh, progress with other things, evaluation and-. (PERSON13) Mhm
(PERSON16) So I, I was doing it it now, just before this call. This is, uh, mainly for the preparation for the domain adaptation, right? (PERSON13) Yeah, uh, uh, also please be in touch with [PERSON4]. We are not so interested in the old people giving their memories as such. (PERSON13) So, in short, he should also scan the web pages of the people. I think for some of them, we are calculating exactly the way we should do if you see the code? So if you could look at this, this would be extremely, uh, extremely useful. And the the idea that I have is that we use again a brute force. And, uh, we pass all our training data through [PROJECT8] and other systems in an automated way so that we get the data distorted, uh, um, in the same way as these platforms distort it, and also that we will use a frequency filter to cut down on the hate, on the like high frequencies. That it will be some scripting of of user interface in, uh, in [PROJECT15], and and uh-. But otherwise I suggest that you, uh, move or give more priority to the the write up of the experiment with [PERSON5], because he will also be struggling. (PERSON13) Thanks [PERSON7] for the suggestion, uh, to just to use [PROJECT10] audio codec. Sometimes we use one component, uh, sometimes we us, uh, another component. And because we will have some non native English speakers in there, so we will need to get some feedback, from the people that are using our subtitles. Just, I called my dentist and asked him, okay, I can come one hour later. So, the, uh, we have [PERSON3] so [PERSON3], please tell us what is your status. I have already provided, uh, [PROJECT13], one [PROJECT13] interview in the confidential part. So that the next week same time, uh, you can present the summary, uh, of which, uh, [PROJECT14] systems and which [PROJECT1] systems we have at hand. I haven't sent them the transcripts yet, because, uh, I shall have to rerun the transcript late. I'm saying that it has to be committed to the [PROJECT12] test set evaluations, because the bleu scores will be definitely lower. But , uh, the idea is that, um, I, um, I align, uh, training data that we have. I create new recordings from, from the words from the separate words. And because we can't store fifty million recordings on the disc-. (PERSON13) So-
But can you do it like in a rolling buffer on the disks so that you would actually be training over whatever, let's say-. (PERSON13) <unintelligible>
(PERSON13) I thought so, I thought, so, but, uh, I need to-. Please talk to her, uh, uh, giving, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And the second part is the content bearing, and ,uh, would get very likely aligned to this, uh, to the late part of the German verb would get aligned to the English word. Due, uh, uh, uh because the, uh, the proportional position of "gezacht" is at the end of the segment. So your solution does not have the problem here, but I think it still has the problem here. So the the verb itself is not expected any sooner than the source verb was uttered. So the proportion or alignment directly values will all require these words to be emitted, like it they would, it would expect these words to be emitted sooner than a previous word. Maybe if the sentence is not very good, but it has a meaning. If in German, uh, yes, if, for example, you, you cannot say the rest before saying there verb. (PERSON13) I'm thinking, so I'll I'll write the paper as if we are doing this already. (PERSON13) Uh, my question on [PERSON2] and you is now, if we if you are able to, uh, come up with an example so that we would actually replace the. Ah, in the pictures, these pictures are okay, but, uh, if we were able to illustrate this, uh, 
this alignment, it, would be perhaps even better. That we, uh, simply equidistantly split this time, uh, into the words based on their length. The formula should be like, what is the value for the word "Ein" or the eath word, uh, uh,  in the table T. 
So how do we arrive at this three o four. And it should be just the proportion of the characters in "Oh das ist" 
And then I don't know whether you do include or do not include design "ein" in the total number of characters from. If you apply the formula to O itself, it should obviously arrive at two, three, five. Okay, I will I will check this very carefully and will answer you in email if it is something else. But or if it is not, I will write all of this details, you said. (PERSON6) You can answer me in Persian, it is okay, [PERSON2]. >
(PERSON6) <unintelligible>
It considers these partial words. And for example takes some estimation for the first word, second word, third word. For example if it is seventh, for example if it is fifth word it calculated it. Oh, that is because it is proportional in the number of words. But the problem is that there is nothing in the paper that would allow people to calculate this. But all of these calculations are in the formula, I think, because if you remember the formula. First ot finds the place, for example, is between the word of, for example, the first and the second word. Uh, that would be, uh, better, uh, there will be, uh, one that would show the alignment,
(PERSON6) Just one more thing [PERSON13]. I'm surprised if you still do not have that access
(PERSON6) That's a good news [PERSON13]. And after all of this, I will send you an email, because I think I, maybe I might be not available in January to the first of February. Uh, push, push the people to do the job, and also try to integrate it yourself. So actually, it just occurred to me that I'll probably also add you simply to [ORGANIZATION9] teams.
