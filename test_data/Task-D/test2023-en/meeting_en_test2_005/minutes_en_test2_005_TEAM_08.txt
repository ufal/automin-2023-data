(PERSON8) Yeah, I was just going to message him that <unintelligible> are we meeting today or not? (PERSON3)  So the thing is that we are not going for special sessions, right? So program committee, key note speakers everything we have to choose, okay? (PERSON2) And why not to do a shared task at [ORGANIZATION2]. And the next proposal would come for 2022 would, which would be too late for us. Because both of them are well recognized in the community and our. The like, uh, time periods between proposals, submission and your, uh, final paper submission was  
five months. (PERSON8) Ah, one more thing, uh, which is coming to my mind is. Because all the participants are going to,uh, experiment with our data, right? And before that, we have to get an ISC endorsement that the speech community is endorsing our  
proposals. And then only, uh, we have to make a full fledged, uh, proposal for like workshop program and then  
submit. <other_noise>
(PERSON3) So it should be very much double work. (PERSON2) If they accept us both to [ORGANIZATION2] and uh, uh, this [ORGANIZATION11]. Because, uh, since it would be entirely on to us, we don't need twelve submission. (PERSON3) I talked to him, and there was some things <unintelligible>, <laugh>. (PERSON3) Okay, no, I'm just asking, suppose [PERSON2] where, we have to pay some fees somewhere for our  
workshop. (PERSON3) I think it will be mostly focused on machine translation. Um, like all the statistical machine translation, all the paper. So if he is aware of this, then I think he can be interested in. Did he mention that we are going to publish in the proceedings? Uh I, uh, uh, I kn- I know something called, uh, [PROJECT1] from [ORGANIZATION14]. So I think maybe we can defer this discussion with [PERSON7]. I will be glad to read the proposal and to, uh, to write some chapters to the proposal, so-. The only thing is, we have to do double work, ah, that is the thing.
