-[PERSON6]'s progress check
--[PERSON6] is working on attention metrices and different patterns.
--[PERSON3] is helping with visualisations of the [PROJECT9] metrices.
--Comparing [PROJECT9] and [PROJECT8] heat maps is difficult because different parameters potentially are varying the outcomes.

--1.1 must be reviewed and rewritten.
--5.3.1 needs more figures, tables, and conclusion.
--5.3.2 is almost finished.

--5.4 needs to be rewritten with less detail. 

-[PERSON11]'s progress check
