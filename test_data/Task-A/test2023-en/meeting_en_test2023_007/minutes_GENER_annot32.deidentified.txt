Attendees: [PERSONUNKNOWN], [PERSON1], [PERSON2], [PERSON7], [PERSON167], [PERSON9]
Purpose of the meeting: updates from team members

- Participants joining the call and technical issues being resolved 
-- All participants manage to join and technical issues are successfully remedied.

- Preparations for two upcoming sessions: holocaust survivors and theatre 
-- Theatre has been postponed by a month allowing extra time for preparation.
-- Further help with preparations from the attendees is encouraged, but none of the attendees can commit to it.
-- The theatre event is going to consist of two interleaved parts, pre-recorded one and a live discussion. 
-- Backup person for a preliminary meeting in the theatre has to be selected.
-- A backup person is appointed. 
-- The theatre event will take place on 26th of February.
-- An individual responsible for recording is necessary for the holocaust survivors event, however the matter is not further discussed. 

- Ladder climbing
-- Use of simple autogenerated html tables is suggested.
-- Such solution could be difficult to prepare. 
-- Use of Weights and Biases web-based solution is briefly considered but not recommended. 
-- Several scripts need to be moved to appropriate location.
-- Automatic runner needs to be set up.
-- A conversion from the tables into html is to be created and the results are meant to be regularly uploaded to a webpage.
-- Another option is access from the webpage directly to the results in html.
-- This option would be useful for people outside of [ORGANIZATION2].

- Progress made by individual participants on projects
-- Most participants are quite busy.
-- Participants made a varying level of progress.
-- D 1.5 and D 6.3 are seen as good metrics.

- Discussion of upcoming projects and plans
-- Having an idea of word ratio between two languages would be helpful.
-- Having explicit lists with banned and desirable words is highly desirable.
-- Manually created references will be needed for that.
-- A dictionary for the holocaust survivors event is due soon.
-- Someone to prepare the lists of desired and undesired words is needed, several possibilities are mentioned, but no final decision is made.
-- Segmenter is agreed to be insufficient and requiring improvement. 
-- Following Wednesday will be a discussion with partners about the way the delay scores are being calculated.
-- Some delay scores need to be prepared for that. 
-- Scores for one file will suffice. 
-- Moving forward the work for ladder climbing is to be done over time and not before a deadline. 
-- Preparation of the presentation is also to be done earlier and not immediately before the deadline.
-- Selection of systems used for the two upcoming events is to be an informed one
-- A system which was previously administrated by an individual who left UFAL needs to be revived.
-- It has already been revived.

- Selection of data set
-- Most papers are not using Common voice, but it provides additional data about speakers and does not include native speakers.
-- More than one data set is a preferable option.
-- Common voice is recommended to be one of the data sets.
-- Common voice alone is not enough however.
-- More frequently used data sets have the advantage of allowing easier comparison between papers.
-- Best course of action is to combine any easily obtainable and convertible data sets.
-- Karlsruhe has already provided links to some relevant data.

- Further discussion of upcoming projects and plans
-- Multiple participants will work on reviving the unadministrated system and train ASRs.
-- Multiple participants plan on focusing on non-native speech.
-- A call between these participants and someone who has some knowledge of the system in question is seen as the best course of action. 
-- They will watch instructional video first but are already aware of some of its shortcomings.
-- Cooperation is seen as desirable because they plan to use different models. 
-- The call is likely to take place on Monday.
-- A new member of the team should also be included in the call.

- Language recognition and its usage in multi-lingual models
-- A participant created Language recognition software, which differentiates between Czech, English and German.
-- Concrete manner of implementation into pipeline will have to be considered.
-- One possible option would involve language recognition and multiple ASRs as well as a merging tool, which the team currently does not possess. 
-- Another possibility is to add the language recognition into an ASR, where it would have the task of silencing it if the input is in a different language.
-- Multilingual models would be the most straightforward option.
-- These would always translate into English and then form English into another language. 
-- A multi-lingual ASR would make the language recognition obsolete for this usage.
-- A direct translation without intermediary language might be preferable, but the most important factor for this decision is the quality of data for different language combinations.
-- Multi-lingual models are not necessarily worse than bilingual.
