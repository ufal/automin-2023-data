PURPOSE OF THE MEETING: to check the progress of individual participants and share their results within the team; to discuss further steps and plan future events 
-       Main agenda of the meeting: to discuss the so-far as well as future progress regarding esp. the following projects (milestones): multi-lingual machine translations; report on integration, deliverables, and the [PROJECT3] test set, a trade fair of students companies – competition 90 sec in a lift; [PROJECT3] Clearest voice: data gathering at the fair; [ORGANIZATION3] Congress Part 1; [PROJECT1] 2021; smaller upcoming events: Centre for visual history of Malach – conference, and AI-written theatre play premiere; bigger events of the past year: [PROJECT1] and [PROJECT2] (feedback + discussion on future improvements); Rainbow workers and dockerized models (multilingual, multi-target models); [ORGANIZATION5] -speech interpretation corpus; practical issues: sub-teams creation, plan of future weekly calls. 
-	Introduction: sharing the agenda with all participants and highlighting main points/deadlines (last call before Christmas), checking practicalities (payments for the work done etc.). 
-	Multilingual machine translation: a participant approves it is ready for a review.
-	Report on integration (and five-to-five languages translations) 
--  it is a teamwork, individual bits are checked and put together: some attendees have already finished their parts, and others will finish them soon: the finished parts are going to be reviewed by the meeting´s organizer ASAP.
-- Necessary to provide more data – esp. numbers from [PROJECT3] test set (responsibility of another participant, who´s not present in the call, not completely done yet).
-      Discussion on [PROJECT3] test set: crucial for most of the discussed project, necessary data must be extracted from it.
-- a few problems occurred regarding the use of [PROJECT3] test sets in one of the deliverables projects: [PROJECT3] data are not represented up to the expected amount, some participants´parts are still missing, there´s already a delay.  
-- generally, the progress is still quite good.
--  training of five-to-five mutual language translations is going on, incl. the following: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish Multi-target models and a necessary number of workers discussed  (it´s not finished yet but the progress is fine).
-- next call scheduled for January (esp. to discuss the number of workers necessary and how to save costs).
-- Milestone 12 (= Improved ASR systems) discussed (as it was a starting point of this sub-topic): not ready yet, necessary to get and share more data. Summary + a reminder of future steps and deadlines 
-	The trade fair of students companies 
-- will be used mainly as a test session and for data gathering. 
-- in March, online (details about the platform, applications, etc. will be specified later). 
-- already experience from the previous year (revision of this experience + how to use it in preparation for this year.
-- Competition “90 seconds in the lift”: important.
-- own presentation will be prepared only if really necessary (to make the fair´s organizers agree with using it as a test session and for data gathering).  
-- Competition “[PROJECT3] Clearest Voice”: should be focused on (the most important part of the fair). 
- [ORGANIZATION3] Congress Part 1
-- in mid-April: necessary to prepare the models by that time, the issue of getting interpreters. 
-  [PROJECT1]2021 
-- the prepared systems will be shown/given available publicly.
-- it´s important to get feedback after the event, recordings will be crucial. 
- Smaller events:  Malach (Holocaust survivors) conference, and a computer-written theatre play.
-- both can be used as smaller test sessions, participants were asked about their preferences. 
- Experience/feedback from [PROJECT1] 2020 and [PROJECT2].
-- quite critical feedback: the past mistakes are pointed out so they can be avoided next time (esp. bad time management, technical issues with recordings and equipment). 
-- necessary to appoint volunteers to make sure the recordings will be of good quality next time +  requirement by the team leader/meeting organizer to have everything ready in advance. 
- Discussion on Rainbow workers and models, dockerization (the best way how to do it, who will be involved)
-- practical issues: number of workers/models, who should be involved to provide further models. 
-- comparison of various systems in terms of their speed, costs an overall effectivity 
-- dockerization: some problems occurred and it´s not ready yet,  more tests need to be done, paid servers might be used 
- Simultaneous SLT: problems occurred (related to different word order in English and German): discussion on possible solutions. 
-- Speech interpretation corpus might help + 10 hours of manually transcribed recording, [ORGANIZATION5] as a source of data
- suggestion to use data augmentation (approved as useful, further details discussed). 
- Conclusion: suggestions on how to stay motivated, cooperate more, and make further progress after Christmas (details of cooperation discussed)
-- Doodle poll for Monday check-up sessions.
-- sub-teams created which will have weekly calls about their progress; concluding notes to other topics 
-- Finally, the organizer summarized the main work done (satisfied – the main milestones were mainly reached) and reminded the participant again of the upcoming events and deadlines; conclusion
