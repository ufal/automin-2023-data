Purpose of meeting: settle next meetings, to discuss how the tasks are going

- Following meetings
-- The following two meetings (December 21st and 28th) are going to be cancelled.
-- The next one will be January 4th.

- Information about meeting with partners previous Thursday:
-- New task to have done is to review one of the deliverables.

- Discussing multi-source
-- Still collecting data for the multi-source.
-- No responce from  [ORGANISATION1]  yet.
--  [PERSON1] is going to start working on a separate set of experiment (multi-lingual multi-source translation).

- Negative constraints
-- Data for the negative constrains are being generated, prepared.
-- There may be problems with the decoder (proceeding only one sentence at the time), but they'd be easily fixable.

- Positive constraints
-- So far done is only data manipulation.
-- Problem with the speed has been discovered:
--- The process of data tokenizing is done repeatedly but can be done just once.
--- The problem will be fixed.

- Getting a deliverable from another co-worker
-- It's better to ask for the preview during the week.
-- Deadline for the first version is on December 21st and for the complete version to be submitted is on  December 31st.
-- An e-mail will be sent to remind the co-worker to send a link for the deliverable in advance.
