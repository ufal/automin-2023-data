<another_language/>
(PERSON7) Hi [PERSON9], or it's the -
<another_language/>
(PERSON9) Hey guys.
(PERSON7) Hi.
So hm how is it with the holidays? 
Or they're they're not until -
Oh how is it in Brazil with with Christmas?
Do you do you have holidays before the Christmas Day or or only Christmas Day and the following days?
(PERSON9) Um I think it is just some Christmas Day?
(PERSON7) (Oh really?)
Okay.
(PERSON9) Yeah, because everybody works until -
(PERSON7) M-hm.
(PERSON9) 24th.
(PERSON7) M-hm.
(PERSON9) (?? 24th then ??)
(PERSON7) So -
(PERSON9) But this period is like people are not really really working.
It's just like a lazy work.
(PERSON7) Yeah like yeah, I do understand.
So, like, good news is that basically we do have holidays officially until or 24, 25, 26, right?
That's the official state holiday in Czech.
So don't expect any any additional work on those days.
(PERSON9) I will consider I'm I'm in in Czech Republic.
(PERSON7) Yeah yeah yeah you know, you are paid by us, so you can follow our our holidays.
(PERSON9) And you have a lot of holidays in fact.
(PERSON7) Yeah. 
(PERSON9) Maybe -
(PERSON7) That that's why we do not have many things done. <laugh/> 
(PERSON9) (You guys don't work a lot.)
(PERSON7) Yeah.
It depends.
Okay, so we're waiting for [PERSON2] I guess. 
(PERSON9) (?? he's)
(PERSON7) Probably for -
(??) is here so possibly for [PERSON4] because he was on the lecture today.
And maybe [PERSON6].
But since [PERSON6] is still not online, I guess he's not connecting today.
(PERSON2) Hi guys.
(PERSON7) Hi.
(PERSON9) [PERSON2].
Hi
(PERSON7) So, maybe like what we can start (with) is next meetings.
So next week it's still workday but I have officially vacation.
I'm on vacation, so I'm not sure whether I will be joining.
But yeah technically I will.
(PERSON5) (I'm also on vacation.)
(PERSON7) Yeah so I -
(PERSON2) (I believe I) me too I think I think I (wrote) something like that so technically I'm also on (vacation).
(PERSON7) Okay so so if if most of us is on vacation so let's cancel the meeting on 21st?
(PERSON2) If I'm by me I I don't really care.
(PERSON7) Mhm.
(PERSON9) I agree.
(PERSON7) And how about 28th?
Like again, people might have just uh vacation or or days off on the on the day.
(PERSON5) Yeah, I have vacation. <laugh/>
(PERSON7) Okay, so technically ah 21st and 28th uhh will be cancelled, I can ask [PERSON4] whether he has different plans or something but yeah i guess (??).
Mmm okey mmm.
So. 
Good.
Other than that.
So regarding the last meeting with the partners.
Ah good news is that yeah they were not bothering us with paraphrasing or over integration, so it's not that (hot).
We got additional work.
But it's not that much like basically since we are not writing (any) deliverables now ah we will -
We (??) to review one of the deliverables.
I'm not sure, whether we were assigned, which one.
There's a dissemination and mmm quality estimation or -
Hi [PERSON4]!
(PERSON5) Yes yes yes, quality estimation or (?? to) [PERSON4].
(PERSON7) Okay good so we have the more fun deliverable.
Uhh.
(PERSON5) Like it was first assigned in the other way around but then uhh [PERSON4] asked for the other deliverable and - 
(PERSON7) ([PERSON4] faught for us) and and now we -
During the -
(PERSON5) (??) said that he would also like this deliverable but then -
(PERSON7) Yeah obviously.
(??)  what's the review dissemination. 
<laugh/>
Okay so so basically I guess me and [PERSON4] and maybe [PERSON5] we can we can review it but but we don't need more more than two or three people on that.
Even two people should be more than enough, right?
(PERSON4) Two is definitely more than enough.
Like that's -
(PERSON7) Yeah.
(PERSON4) It will be good to have someone aside from me, because I'm a -
(PERSON7) Mhm okay, I can -
(PERSON4) So -
(PERSON7) I can I can (vulunteer).
Ahhh yeah.
And back to back to the vacation I was discussing with others uh that on 21st and 28th most of us will have uh holidays or days off so we can cancel these meetings?
(Or) do we want to have them anyway?
[PERSON4]? 
(PERSON4) Yeah well I'll I planned to be at work on 21st but the kids got their extended school vacation very likely.
So it would be hard for me probably anyway.
(PERSON7) So so -
(PERSON4) So let's cancel those two.
(PERSON7) Yeah, since there is nothing urgent until the end of the year I think we can we can have these two meetings cancelled?
And the next one will be on the January - January the 4th, right?
So I guess we can agree on that, right?
Yeah, okay.
So other than that, let's discuss the multi-source and (??) navigation, so -
Regarding multi-source [PERSON5] we we are still trying to collect the data.
Like I I wrote an email to [PERSON1] and she said that we should bother her after New Year's because she has some other deadlines.
And you probably didn't get (in) any response from the [ORGANIZATION1], right?
(PERSON5) No, I did not. 
(PERSON7) Okay, so are there any other options?
Or like technically when we get the data from [PERSON1] we can start working on it.
(PERSON5) Mhm.
(PERSON7) So that's fine.
And I can try prepare at least some baselines for the multi-lingual multi-source translation, which can be like separate set of experiment.
(PERSON5) Mhm.
(PERSON7) But I still haven't got to that.
Hmm but I guess that that's it regarding (this task) right now.
(PERSON5) Yeah, I'm like I'm not working on it much.
Or I I have't been working on it much this week because I'm still ah working on the like side project of PDT we just -
They asked me to help them since I'm li-
I was working on the alignment in PCEDT on the last (PCVT) so -
Yeah but so, so I hope, like this week I will finish it then and I can again concentrate on on this stuff.
(PERSON7) Mhm.
(PERSON5) Like in January.
(PERSON7) Okay yeah so I guess I guess that's that's uh all regarding the multi-source.
And or so let's move to the (??) navigation.
Uh so if I'm correct you are focused on the (positive constraints) rigt now, right?
Or are you -
(PERSON9) Yeah so -
(PERSON7) Yeah, mhm.
(PERSON9) We're still working on the the negative co-
Now in order to to train the model for negative constraints.
So hmm as (to) generating the data for that actually we're using a (??) as as we have discussed and it's almost done but it's still processing.
And at the same time now I'm going to start to investigate if the problem with (foreign flection) happens or and with negative constraints (??) constrain the code, right.
(PERSON7) So you're preparing data for the negative constraints, because you already have the data for the positive constraints.
(PERSON9) Yeah, yeah perfect but -
(PERSON7) Okay.
(PERSON9) [PERSON2] has to train the model -
(PERSON7) Mhm. 
(PERSON9) Using negative constraints in the input.
So 
(PERSON7) Mhm.
(PERSON9) (I need) to prepare that data, and ah so it's too it's too processing.
Ah, I have the ah the (test set of ??) but need (to) train set as well, (a translaton of that so) -
I'm preparing it and I think it'll be ready uh soon. 
Uh a part of that I'm using the the (Marion) implementation of negative constraints to to -
(PERSON2) Did you manage to get (it done)?
(PERSON9) (??)
(PERSON2) (Does it work?)
(PERSON9) S- Sorry?
I I I didn't -
(PERSON2) Did you manage to get (it run)?
(PERSON9) (test that yet.)
(PERSON2) Okay okay.
Yeah I didn't I didn't test that.
I would try it today.
(PERSON2) (Perfect.)
(PERSON9) And because I I'm I'm still finishing the the the (code) to the rappel so I was -
(PERSON2) Yeah sure, of course.
(PERSON9) (??)
(PERSON2) Because I think you you will run into some problems, because I'm not that (??).
(PERSON9) Oh yeah. 
<laugh/>
(PERSON2) (Probably but -)
(PERSON9) (I asked ??) 
(PERSON2) (??) something feels weird, tell me, because I did not really test it that properly.
But it should work, somehow.
(PERSON9) Yeah it should.
(PERSON2) I'm not sure about the (batching). 
I didn't look into that.
I know I wanted to implement (batching) but right now I'm not sure because I think it didn't feel worth it because all the sentences were separate in the files either either way.
So I think I only use it separate sentences.
So I'm not sure if you can -
Like if the if the input files format for the constraints allow for more than one sentences or input but that that's like a really easy fix.
But right now I'm not sure if it will work with more than one sentence.
But if it doesn't just tell me and I'll fix it right away.
(PERSON7) It just can -
Can I uh just just to make make it clear for myself.
Uhh.
You you're saying that you can process only one sentence at the time.
But yet on the other hand, you (also were) training systems for the constraint (decoding).
Or is that is that something different?
(PERSON2) No, I I mean for the for the constraints that are done in the dec- (Marion) decoder for my -
Uh for the modification (sided) to decoding for the negative constraints with ah the trees and the stuff we discussed like months ago.
(PERSON7) Oh I see, okay so so -
(PERSON2) Because all the all the test set was just uh one sentence.
Each file was one sentence.
I think I did it like the stupid way.
I called (Marion) each time for each file and -
I think it's possible.
I didn't implement using more than one sentences profile but - 
(PERSON7) Oh yeah yeah.
(PERSON2) I's like probably the format so.
(PERSON7) Oh I I I see.
So so the other other, the the more efficient method was just ah (appending) the constraints.
(PERSON2) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON7) The training is like this (??)
(PERSON2) (??) is just about the modification of the decorder.
(PERSON7) Mhm.
(PERSON2) I'm I'm not sure about that, but it -
If it doesn't work it is easily fixable.
But the (Marion) constraining is inference only li- right?
You do not need it for -
(PERSON2) Yeah -
(PERSON7) Training so -
(PERSON2) Yeah yeah yeah.
(PERSON7) So I think it's not such problem that you can only process one sentence at the time.
Okay.
(PERSON2) We'll see.
Well, either way -
(PERSON4) That's for the that's for the negative contrains because for the - 
(PERSON2) Yes.
(PERSON4) Positive constraints, it's only data manipulation.
You just say that in the training data what in the source -
(PERSON2) Oh yeah I I tried like really really simple baseline method that I used all the subwords from the constraint and add it some (bonus) to the soft (pocks) for these tokens in each steps but -
(PERSON4) So that's the positive constraints.
It's or -
(PERSON2) Yes, that's that's the only stuff I did for positive constraints .
With the negative constraints I did something a little bit more complicated in the decoding.
Like filtering out the beams and replacing the beams with different beams.
And for like multi-token constraints and this kind of stuff.
But for the positive constraints I only tried -
Or I only compared the training approach with yeah just this very simple stuff.
Just modifying the scores in each step in the same way.
(PERSON7) Okay, so back back to the positive constraints.
Were you already focusing on the analysis of the system?
(PERSON2) Yeah right now I'm I'm kind of waiting on the dataset reprocessing from ([PERSON9]).
Also [PERSON9] I had a look at the (code) and I think I know why it's so slow.
Because you for for you for for each -
Yeah for for each entry in the terminology in the (Europar) reprocessing.
You open the dataset, tokenize it, read it line by line, tokenize it line by line and then close it.
But you only you do that -
(PERSON9) Oh yeah (??)
(PERSON2) Like (14000) times -
(PERSON9) Yeah
(PERSON2) And you can do this only once, right?
So 
(PERSON9) Yeah -
(PERSON2) We are doing it like (14000) times.
So I think that that that is probably the problem with the speed.
So if you just move that before the (four loap), it's probably -
(PERSON9) Yeah.
(PERSON2) It's probably okay.
(PERSON9) I will check that.
(Europro) I had to start it over again because of the what you said about the English term, right?
So -
(PERSON2) Yeah. 
(PERSON9) Since it it has just started I can I can change it in and save some time.
(PERSON2) I think it should be much faster than that.
Like yeah, for for the analysis I started to work on -
Or, I'm almost finished with changing (Marion) in a way that it outputs all the (attentional incoder decoder attentional weights).
So we see what the decorder (look set) when it generates some work.
And we can check if it really looks at the constraints when generating the target constraint.
If it looks at the source constraints.
And yeah, so that's (important issue ??) that's almost done.
And then we have to figure out what we are looking for and what we want to see there, I guess.
(PERSON7) Okay so technically ah, yeah, we can, we can discuss it even like (??) Monday meetings.
You can update me.
(PERSON2) Yeah yeah.
(PERSON7) During the course.
During the (week).
Yeah okay, so that's fine.
And I guess that's that's everything like -
Is there anything else we need to discuss now?
[PERSON4] do you know when when are we supposed to get the deliverables from the -
(PERSON4) I haven't checked that -
(PERSON7) (?? We we -)
(PERSON4) (Do we have that ?? flink) already?
Is there (??)
(PERSON7) Probably not.
I guess we would get an e-mail.
Okay I will -
(PERSON4) (??)
(PERSON7) I will keep an eye on the on the on the updates.
(PERSON4) If I remember correctly it was on uh in a week from now, the the first complete version.
That's (what I) asked for, 21st. 
Uhh and then some updates still may come over the over the Christmas break.
(PERSON7) Mhm.
(PERSON4) But hopefully no later than on the 21st, we should get the the full version.
And I hope I actually - 
Please ask [PERSON3] earlier, because I think it would be better to have an a preview already during this week.
(PERSON7) Yeah (I will do that).
Basically just at least some text to review, even if it's not complete.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON7) Yeah okay.
So I will I will check the (??) and try to keep the (eye on it).
And you said 21st?
Or when should we get that?
(PERSON5) 21st is the first version and I think the deadline, like for the deliverable to be submitted is the end of the year.
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON5) (31st.)
(PERSON4) So, I remember that for [PROJECT1] I was doing this from last year ah, from some cottage in the mountains.
And I just realized, shortly before the the New Year's evenings that I need to submit it.
And ah <laugh/> so this is also something that will happen to [PERSON8] I'm afraid that he could be -
Well, no party, but maybe at the remote party.
And then suddenly he would realize that he has to submit a (??). 
So there will be no review of like at that point. <laugh/>
He would simply take the PDF and upload it so. <laugh/>
(PERSON7) Well, okay.
So, Yeah, I will check on 21st, and otherwise I will send them an e-mail (??)
(PERSON4) Please I think better to send them an e-mail right now and just ask for that link ah, ah in in advance.
(PERSON7) Okay, mmm okay.
(PERSON4) Yep thanks.
(PERSON7) Do we have other issues to discuss today, or is that is that everything until the New Year?
(PERSON6) Yeah, so for the (??) 
(PERSON7) Okay [PERSON6].
(PERSON6) I hope there was't anything for me?
Or?
(PERSON7) Not not specifically.
(PERSON6) Okay.
A good news is that the paraphrasing or (??) was not brought up last Thursday so-
(PERSON6) <laugh/>
(PERSON7) There are other or urgent things right now so it is fine.
Okay so if that that's all I guess yeah see you see you next year I guess.
And have have a nice holiday.
(PERSON4) Yeah yeah yeah exactly.
So [PERSON6], if if if we could maybe stay here for a little (??) for for the (outings). 
(PERSON6) (Okay okay.)
(PERSON4) Otherwise, I agree with [PERSON7].
I think [PROJECT2] is good and safe from our side.
(PERSON7) Okay so -
(PERSON4) Okay, thanks.
(PERSON5) Have a nice Christmas if possible.
(PERSON4) Have a nice Christmas (??)
Yeah.
If possible, exactly. <laugh/>
Bye bye.
(PERSON2) Bye.
(PERSON5) Bye.
