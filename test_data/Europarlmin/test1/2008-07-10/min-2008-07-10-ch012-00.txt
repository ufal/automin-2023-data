12. Quorum (continuation)

The President recalled the procedure to which he had referred at the start
of the debate (minutes of 10.07.2008, item 10). He noted that only five
signatories of the request were present, and that no Member supported it.
As a result he decided to proceed with the vote on motions for resolutions
on cases of violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
