<SPEAKER ID="134" NAME="Hartmut Nassauer" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(DE) Mr President, I wish to return to the subject of the final vote on the Susta report. We accidentally voted against it in the final vote, when we meant to vote in favour. This resulted from slight confusion about the oral amendment. I would ask you to accept our intention to vote in favour of the report in the final vote.
