Welcome
<SPEAKER ID="057" NAME="President">
Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to inform you that a delegation from the Japanese Parliament has arrived in the official gallery. We would like to extend a warm welcome to them. They are taking part in the 29th EP/Japan Interparliamentary Meeting that is being held in Brussels and Vienna from 2 to 6 June.
<P>
The Japanese delegation is led by Mr Taro Nakayama, a great friend of Europe, and is made up of seven members of the House of Representatives and two members of the House of Councillors.
<P>
This Interparliamentary Meeting has focused on climate change in order to promote a common approach based around the application of the Kyoto Protocol and what will come after it.
<P>
We are very happy with this fruitful, stable and continued cooperation with Japan, a country with which we share the basic values of democracy, respect for human rights and the principle of multilateral cooperation. Therefore, welcome to our Japanese friends!
<P>
(Applause)
