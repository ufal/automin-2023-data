7. Kosovo (vote) 
<P>
Before the vote on Amendment 2:
<SPEAKER ID="078" NAME="Johannes Lebech" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, we found that it would not be fair to mention just one of the parties, so we would like to take out the reference to the Kosovo authorities. The amendment would then read: 'Underlines the importance of full regional economic cooperation and the obligation to comply with and fully implement the provisions of the CEFTA Agreement'.
