<P>
After the vote on Amendment 3
<SPEAKER ID="152" NAME="Doris Pack" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(DE) Madam President, I would like to ask whether you realise that, in Article 6, the word 'central' before the word state needs to be deleted to make the wording consistent with the other texts.
<SPEAKER ID="153" NAME="President">
Yes, yes, we are definitely going to check all of the language versions, Mrs Pack.
