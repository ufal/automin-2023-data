1. A Council statement on the situation in Guinea would be placed on
Wednesday's agenda as the second item, following the Council and Commission
statements on the outcome of the referendum in Ireland (item 2 on the final
draft agenda).

2. Motions for resolution to wind up debate on passenger compensation in
the event of airline bankruptcy (item 12 on the final draft agenda): the
vote would take place during the October II part-session.

Parliament accepted these proposals.

The following spoke: Joseph Daul, on behalf of the PPE Group, who moved the
request, Francesco Enrico Speroni, on behalf of the EFD Group, and Martin
Schulz, on behalf of the S-D Group.

Parliament rejected the request by roll-call vote (268 in favour, 284
against, abstentions 18).

The item therefore remained on the agenda.

Request by the PPE Group that the debate on freedom of information in Italy
not be wound up with the tabling of motions for resolution.

The following spoke: Daniel Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,
against the request, and Mario Mauro, on behalf of the PPE Group, in favour
of the request.

Parliament rejected the request by roll-call vote (286 in favour, 293
against, abstentions 18).

The debate would therefore be wound up by tabling motions for resolution,
which would be put to the vote during the next part-session.

The order of business was thus established.
