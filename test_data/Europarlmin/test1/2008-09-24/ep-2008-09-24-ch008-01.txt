- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="109" NAME="Pilar del Castillo Vera">
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I am not going to speak for long as I am aware that we are subject to time pressures. However, I too want to thank everyone who took part in this report and underline one very important point: what Parliament is offering today in relation to the legislative review of the electronic communications sector, as already stated by Catherine Trautmann, is wholly consistent and, we believe, will be very positive in terms of developing this market. The negotiations now beginning must reach their conclusion within this parliamentary term. I believe that this is therefore decisive for the sector.
