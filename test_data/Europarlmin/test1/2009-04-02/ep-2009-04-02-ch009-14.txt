Mr President, I would like to ask you to include the following Commission statement on the record, with the text as agreed and adopted.

The study foreseen in Article 6(5)(a) of the Ecolabel Regulation, dealing with additional aspects such as processing, pre-packaging, packaging and transport, which will examine the flexibility of the extension of the scope of the Ecolabel Regulation to food, including the products of fishing and aquaculture, will not influence or prejudge the adoption of this regulation'.
