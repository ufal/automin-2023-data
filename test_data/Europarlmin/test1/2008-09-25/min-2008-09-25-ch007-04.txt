4 7.4. Concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union
(vote)

Report: on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union
[2007/2253(INI)] - Committee on Culture and Education. Rapporteur: Marianne
Mikko (A6-0303/2008)

(Simple majority)

(Voting record: 'Results of votes', Item 4)

The following spoke: Ignasi Guardans Camb, who criticised the recent
amendment to Rule 45(2), which he felt made it more difficult to reach
agreement between the political groups, Monica Frassoni, on the same
subject and on the situation of the media in Italy, Marianne Mikko
(rapporteur), Pl Schmitt, who regretted that the report being put to the
vote had not been debated but had simply been the subject of a 'short
presentation' under Rule 131a, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, on the procedure
concerning amendment of that Rule, and Stefano Zappal, on the remarks made
by Monica Frassoni (the President said that Parliament was sovereign as
regards amendments to its Rules, and decided to proceed to the vote).
