<P>
- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="098" NAME="Charlie McCreevy">
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, since the adoption of the new cotton reform by Council in June 2008, much work has been invested in setting up restructuring programmes in the main cotton-producing Member States.
<P>
This proposal is the Commission's response to the Council's invitation to propose adjustments to the framework for these restructuring programmes. The main modification concerns the possibility of introducing an eight-year, instead of a four-year, programme, which would allow for more substantial restructuring operations.
<P>
The Commission thanks the rapporteur for the support given to the Commission proposal.
<SPEAKER ID="099" NAME="President">
We are pleased when the Commission praises our work; this should always be the case.
