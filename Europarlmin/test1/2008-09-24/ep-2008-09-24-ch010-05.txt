- Before the vote on paragraph 25:
<SPEAKER ID="134" NAME="Roberta Angelilli" AFFILIATION="UEN">

I wish to add the following words: 'condemns every act of violence against Christian communities and', and then the original text follows. The reason is that nowhere in the document is there any explicit condemnation of what happened in Orissa; much weaker synonyms are used instead.
<P>

<SPEAKER ID="136" NAME="Daniel Cohn-Bendit" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
(FR) Mr President, when there are racist voices calling for a 'Europe without Muslims', I call on you to intervene!

Mr Cohn-Bendit has indeed spoken.
