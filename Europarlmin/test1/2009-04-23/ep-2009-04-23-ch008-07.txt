(DE) Mr President, I believe that we had a large majority for Amendment 81, with the result that Amendment 12 lapses. Can you just confirm that again, please?
<SPEAKER ID="156" NAME="President">
Yes, you are correct Mr Jarzembowski: Amendment 12 falls.
<SPEAKER ID="157" NAME="Eva Lichtenberger" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
(DE) Mr President, this second amendment can absolutely be viewed as complementary. There is no contradiction. The two amendments do not preclude one another.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with what our coordinator, Mr Jarzembowski, said: Amendment 12 falls.
