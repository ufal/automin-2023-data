Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="147" NAME="Avril Doyle">
rapporteur. - Mr President, this legislation is very necessary as the current legislation on residue control has led to a serious decrease in the availability of authorised veterinary medicines, creating adverse effects for public and animal health and welfare.
<P>
I would like to urge the presidency, particularly the incoming French Minister, to make this dossier a priority to help to resolve the crisis in availability, especially for what we call minor uses and so-called minor species, which include sheep, horses, bees, fish and many other animals that are not so minor in many of our countries.
<P>
However, there is an urgent need to review the Veterinary Medicines Directive according to the outcome of the task force on the availability of veterinary medicines.
<P>
This legislation is just a Band-Aid in terms of the necessity out there. While I welcome it, I urge the incoming French Presidency to give it the priority it needs.
