12. Croatia: 2007 progress report (
<P>
- Before the vote on Amendment 4
<SPEAKER ID="083" NAME="Hannes Swoboda">
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, as I understand it, the PPE-DE has withdrawn Amendment 4, but would like to vote on paragraph 8 in two parts, which I fully support. The first part would go as far as 'on public opinion in Croatia' and the second part would begin with 'urges the Croatian Government'. As I say, the withdrawal of Amendment 4 would mean that we would take the vote in the two parts mentioned.
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted)

- Before the vote on Amendment 12
<SPEAKER ID="085" NAME="Hannes Swoboda">
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, it is simply a matter of replacing the word 'envisages' with 'envisaged'. Time has moved on, so it needs to be put in the past tense.
<P>
- Before the vote on Amendment 15
<SPEAKER ID="087" NAME="Hannes Swoboda">
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, after yesterday's debate in the House, it has become apparent that a large majority would actually be in favour of our replacing the word 'could' with the phrase 'should in any case'. That could produce a broad consensus in the House after all, which would be very important in this instance.
<SPEAKER ID="088" NAME="Bernd Posselt" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(DE) Mr President, I would like to say that if this oral amendment were adopted, my group would vote in favour of Mr Swoboda's motion instead of against.
<SPEAKER ID="089" NAME="President">
You will not know until after the vote, though, whether it has been accepted or not.
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted)
