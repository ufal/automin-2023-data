- Before the vote on Amendment 2
<SPEAKER ID="102" NAME="Marios Matsakis" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, cancer may cause chronic illness and can possibly lead to disability, therefore in order to make new paragraph 34a more accurate and more credible I propose an oral amendment to include the words 'may include' and 'possibly' in the appropriate areas in that subparagraph.
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted)
