ATTENDEES : PERSON10, PERSON10, PERSON6, PERSON9, PERSON5, PERSON3


SUMMARY-

  There was a live workshop dry run at the LOCATION2 on Wednesday.
  The technology works technically, but it's not usable for people who don't speak OTHER3.
  In the next session with PERSON5, they will watch some video in OTHER6.
  If anybody can speak OTHER6 PERSON10 is studying at ORGANIZATION3.
 -PERSON7 will join them for the surge, depending on his availability.
 -PERSON9 is giving a talk on Monday at 2.
 -PERSON9 managed to convert the script into bigger script, so the processing should be faster.
 -PERSON3 will double check if anyone responded to the e-mail.
 -PERSON3 will get in touch with PERSON5 and feed the files to him so he can use them for the Monday talk.
 -PERSON10 worked on three different things this week: a visualization tool on the old realization tool, a server in C++ and a JavaScript piece of code that can be included in any webpage even on a remote machine.
 -PERSON5 will email PERSON3 the scripts to test the ASR.
  He used a data set of 300 million open subtitles from various languages and trained the model with TPU.
 -PERSON3 will send PERSON10 the models that correctly load on the GPU's.
 -PERSON10 will probably have to export them as an open neural network exchange format.
 -PERSON3 and PERSON10 don't know if it's possible to do that PERSON3 wants PERSON10 to send him the data set for PROJECT2.
 -PERSON10 will apply the same models on the same data.
 -PERSON11 has access to the source files.
 -PERSON6 is going back to work part time next week, so she has limited time for this project.
 -PERSON12 helped her integrate buffer in the LOCATION3 segmenter.
 -PERSON5 is looking for a data set with the correct transcripts for the LOCATION3 presentation.
 -PERSON10 wants to create a Wiki page with all the data that they are using, or they plan to use.
  The data ambassador is on vacation this week, so he might not be able to help, but he is the person who knows the most and he will organize this.
