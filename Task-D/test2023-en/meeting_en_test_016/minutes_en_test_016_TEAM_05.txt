-Excuse me, there's no change on slides for videos, there's no change on slides for videos, there's no change on slides for videos.
-other_noise> into script processing should now be faster than other_noise> into script processing.other_noise> into script processing should now be faster than other_noise> into script processing.
-I've looked into the various options available to me and I've sent an email asking for comments about what I found. _noise> I've sent an email asking for comments about what I found.
-The problem is that we don't have enough forms for all related words in corresponding language.<n>Reference "rch" "rch" "rch" "rch"
-In email I was asking about other_noise> The technical process I should process the dictionary because Im not sure if it is necessary or not.
-Please get in touch with [PERSON5], I dunno where [PERSON5 is] today, I dunno where [PERSON5 is], and make sure that he can feed those files to him.
-[PERSON9] synchronizes with [PERSON9], and if provided this [PERSON9other_noise>, it will be very good.
-This seminar is related to the Monday seminar, but not related to the Monday seminar.This seminar is not related to the Monday seminar, the seminar is related to the Monday seminar.
-If we synchronize with [PERSON9], it will be best if we synchronize with [PERSON9], you can try Other_noise>
-If you are searching for LOCATION domain, chances are that you are searching for  LOCATION domain .
-P5 is a presentation of the ideas of the P5 of the P5 of the P5 of the P5 of the P5.
-This week I worked on three different things which could make it possible to visualize sound from microphone signal on a remote machine and see whether it is loud or not.
-[PERSON5], you have already measured word rate a few times, we can directly run random thresholds, [PERSON5], you have scripts to test ASR.
-So we need to set up the tool for this development stage so that we don't have any problem with the output level and if we are running any problem problems with the application.
-Thank you very much for the work you did on the paraphrasing model.This is a good idea and I worked on the other paraphrasing model also on the other model.
-Train the machine translation model using the data set 300 million open subtitles from various languages and deploy this data set today Hopefully it will train the machine translation model.
-The problem is that it was trained with other ways, so it's not able to export the data from the other ways so it's a problem.
-Use a neural network exchange format to exchange data between two computers.<n>Use the neural network exchange format to exchange data between two computers, it could be used to exchange data between them.
-The critical thing is that you have to know architecture of neural network and know architecture of [PROJECT4] and know architecture of [PROJECT4].
-I think that it is safe to use  paraphrasing for server use cases only, not for other use cases, such as for other use cases like other use cases.
-[PERSON5] is a thing for [PERSON5] again as we have not collected any single number from our models in the in as they are in this setup.
-If you could just send your data to the source, you could also send the data to the source if it is not available or if the source is not available.
-Study the different methods of evaluating the different languages, for example, the evaluation of the different languages, the evaluation of the different languages, the evaluation of the different languages, the evaluation of the differences between the different languages, the evaluation of the differences between the different languages, and the evaluation of the different languages.
-The best corpus is actually the best file in which you have already translated into [5], so we need polish data set for this corpus so we can send it to the right people.
-The third thing was paraphrasing server itself, the third thing was the server itself, the third thing was the server itself, the third thing was the third thing.
-Thank you very much for your time on the remote.<n>Okay thank you very much for your time on the remote and for your great work on the remote.
-This week i worked on data collection, i worked on five languages, four five languages five languages five languages and some remaining languages five languages.
-The idea is to translate the words into different languages, for example, for example, for example, we want to translate the words into different languages, for example, for example,
-The problem with [PERSON11] is that it has access to all the source files that it can run all the languages that it has access to.
-So we should try creating the [PROJECT model translation during next week and see what the data look like.<n>So we should try creating the [PROJECT model translation during next week and see what the data look like.
-This week we are going to work on the project of the week, we are going to work on the project of the week, we are going to work on the project of the week.
-The problem with segmenter is that it doesn't give very impressive segments in text. The problem with segmenter is that it doesn't give very impressive segments in text.
-Train it so that it will take all the text and not slow down too much exactly exactly so that we like all incoming text will be full context and not slow down too much exactly.
-Questions for the training on the domain mismatches, whether it's a domain mismatch or not, it's a second sentence which is jumping out of the sentence.
-The data collected from these presentations are presented in the form of graphs, graphs, tables, and other data that can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the presentation of the data.
-Realize that there are other things more important than the speech sentences and that there are other things more important than the speech sentences, such as the fact that there are other things more important than the speech sentences and that there are other things more important than the speech sentences.
-There are various combinations of data that could be used to improve the presentation of the information in the Internet, such as the use of data from the Internet, the use of data from the Internet, the use of data from the Internet, and the use of data from the Internet.
-Create a data set for the user to add to the data set or make a new data set for the user to add to the data set or create a new data set for the user to use.
