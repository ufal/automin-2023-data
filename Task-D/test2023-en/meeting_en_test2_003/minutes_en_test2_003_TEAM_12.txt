yeah yeah so good to good to see you again even yes now moving as well. ah i would only say that once the vaccination drive starts then only like i would like consider of moving to new delhi for the visa and stuffs so yeah. so i think we are like technically we are safe for the first few months of the year but then the way in which we are paying you the the substitute way has probably legal limits which will kind of run out in the middle of the year. so that's my worry that like we we were able to since you started in the middle of the of the previous year we could use like the full year limits for the half year or the less than half year of time.
