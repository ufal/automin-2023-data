Yeah, so I haven't heard from uh, from what- wha- was his name, [PERSON2] uh- yet. (PERSON4) Uh- and then you are moving to Canada, or-

(PERSON7) Yes. (PERSON9) Ah, I would only say that once the vaccination drive starts, uh, then only uh like I would like, consider of, uh moving to New Delhi for the visa and stuffs, so- yeah-

(PERSON4) Oh. (PERSON4) So it's really, uh, uh the- there- there is this hard constraints, which is lurking behind the corner. So we should really, uh, like, even if it was for a short time, I think it's- it's very important that you uh- that you actually do come to do the paperwork, which cannot be done remotely. So, uh, so please, like, do not think that the matter has been solved by uh- by you still, getting the- the money. It has- it has been- the problem has been postponed, but there is a limit on, how far we can push, this. So we can only benefit in the way, that, his tool can be tweaked as- as we would like it to be, we can ask him for features, he will probably include these features and, and uh that would save our processes, then, but he is uh not going to uh- to handle our data, because that would be- like uh I'm- I'm not paying him on the project and, he is already being payed from, a company who also wants, uh, who also want this tool, uh so, uh I- I don't think it would be a- a good idea, if we employed him on the project, because he uh would be effectively, uh, he wouldn't have the time, effectively. So this is what we need, and, um, like- the- you can s- spend the rest of the- the call talking about the, the procedure that we discussed yesterday, uh but I- I don't think there's any- any new input from me at this point. So what I can do is, uh I can try uh, reaching out to, one uh, like, CS student uh, who is also remote and busy, that would be also difficult, and I can try to reach out to another faculty, where they also have uh, like student works uh and, maybe- maybe they would have someone available for- uh for this exercise. (PERSON7) So <unintelligible> that we are going to do is just, insert the words that [PERSON1] prepared, in the text, and polish it? Uh, so there again, uh there has to be some way, uh for the annotators to browse the instances of words, the undecided ones, and decide them. What is not allowed, is to have uncertainty about the status of the process. They would not be supposed to modify it, but just, by accident, they could- they could debug it. Uh and, people would scroll- uh- and you would save this as HTML. And people would open that HTML in, uh- Microsoft Word, uh they would see the uh, the sl- like uh- s- l- light yellow uh, items, and they would- uh, they could uh, somehow mark them red or whatever if there is some problem, or they could s- send us some, maybe it should have also sentence numbers. (PERSON9) I guess I sent uh <unintelligible>-

(PERSON4) Yes, so did I, so uh, uh-

So [PERSON7] surely has the link- uh- the (automatic), uh yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, but uh, one thing is that uh, (if I prepare), eh, those HTML files, uh, the annotators cannot edit them without uh, opening them, in an editor. (PERSON4) They should open the HTML in Word, in Microsoft Word, or whatever, uh an open off- uh, in LibreOffice. And your goal, or the programmer (skull) if you cannot do it yourself, uh, would be to extract the, uh, uh- uh s- the indicators, this is essentially indicators, uh, a- and put them into the, uh- the clean XML format. (PERSON7) So if, if you could find someone else, uh that would be great, but in case no one is available, I will do that, maybe slower, but, I can <unintelligible>. Uh, and then anno-tator, would be someone, specific um, confirmed uh, at token level. <\parallel_talk>

So does this type of annotation, make sense to you, uh to- to all of you, actually? <\parallel_talk>

And they could search for NE question mark, so they would just type control F, control F, that would jump there, and they would double click, uh. Sometimes you have just this short (SAO), or as a sentence, and we don't want to, er, filter all of that as it- if it is- so if it's not so complicated, I would vote for showing more. So it's actually, I think it's even- uh it makes things easier, because we can stick 
to the documents-

(PERSON1) M-hm. (PERSON4) We would only convert them from the current format, which is plain text, uh into this HTML with the, with the, um like, highlighted places. <parallel_talk> So maybe, uh, maybe uh, let's do it like uh green, the- this is not a name, uh, (with the) [PERSON8]'s name and, uh, [PERSON3]'s name. (PERSON4) Okay, yeah, l- let's- it's- it's uh important for, that you are saying this. So then, we would be- this would be uh, not highlighted at all. (PERSON4) They would be doing the bold facing, and italicisation, and, uh, they would be checking, and now, should it be red or should it be, uh, green? (PERSON4) Yeah, so I think that like I'll- I'll- I need to prepare for another, uh call. (PERSON4) So- so there are two things, ah to- to do, so-

<parallel_talk> Um, to dos, one to do is to, um, uh double check, uh, the stages, uh, and whether they are uh clearly, uh, reflected, in XML markup uh options, uh and then uh, test the HTML, uh Word, HTML, and then extraction. Just, uh I was unsure about the table, (getting it) (updated). (PERSON9) The thing is that we need to have all the data processed by February (mid). I will <unintelligible> of how good, the annotation tool will look like <laugh>. So if it's just- click click click click, so it's actually, may have (been) differently. I don't know how he, is able to write minutes quicker than the meeting duration. And uh, let us catch up, maybe, uh, when do you, think we should catch up next, maybe, uh, in the coming week, Monday? So, but uh, I have (vitigated), uh all those things, now he has to review. (PERSON1) Uh, uh, so you se- <unintelligible>-

(PERSON9) It's-

(PERSON1) -definitely. (PERSON9) It's a Google Doc, uh let me, send you, uh-

(PERSON1) Mhm. (PERSON9) So it's in the master document, [PERSON1], if you can- uh if you can see. (PERSON1) Yes, that it's really beautifully snowing, outside. You can look at the numbers in the UK, uh, so, and, not only the numbers, you can see the death rate. Once the vaccine, mass immunation program starts, it will obviously slow the spread. So there is a (margin) of error, for all of them, but it has the ability, to stop the spread. (PERSON1) I just, somehow didn't- <laugh> didn't <unintelligible> so I just thought, I should found somewhere the XML uh, source. And, uh, another thing is, like uh, I will now, like [PERSON4] has some (suggestion) on the website, so, I will make it quickly and send it to him, so that he can send it to the Scientific Commu- Committee, uh, very quickly. But I learned from my colleagues, um like organising, three or four workshops, and, it really helped. That's why I'm, uh, well, kind of, relaxed about, uh, all things. (PERSON9) Yeah, yeah, but it's absolutely, but uh I- I'm just worried that if the situation is not good and, hope everything is okay with her, so, yeah. And, by then, uh, by then uh, let me finish the pending task- uh-

(PERSON1) Yes, yes, and uh, [PERSON9], I'm having another call at half past one, tomorrow. We can even skip tomorrow, and, keep on working, and maybe we can meet <unintelligible>.
