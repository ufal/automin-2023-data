(PERSON8) Can you guys hear me?
(PERSON5) <another_language/>
Yes, I can hear someone.
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/> it is [PERSON8].
(PERSON5) Oh, hi [PERSON8] so, yeah.
(PERSON8) Hi, hi, hi.
(PERSON5) 1, 2, 3, 4 there was the pin, but it's also your net <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON8) <laugh/> okay, I'll fix that <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) That's okay, I like it, it's fine.
(PERSON8) Okay it's fine, okay.
(PERSON5) The recording has already started, as I see.
(PERSON8) Okay, okay.
(PERSON5) And I see [PERSON6] is on the call as well.
(PERSON8) Uhm, okay, okay, okay.
(PERSON5) So but I don't know <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON9) I can hear you guys properly, but lower clear, but -
(PERSON5) Yeah, [PERSON6] is guess I don't know what <unintelligible/>
<another_language/>
(PERSON9) He should be there.
(PERSON5) Was he.
<unintelligible/> in second.
So hear you and see me right?
(PERSON9) Yeah, I cannot see you, but I can hear you.
(PERSON5) So the connection is too slow perhaps because I'm probably -
Or maybe I'm not sharing the camera.
(PERSON9) Yeah, do we do we need to share camera as well?
(PERSON5) No, no.
(PERSON9) Okay, okay, okay.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/> in second <unintelligible/>.
<other_noise/>
So I am already connected with [PERSON9].
(PERSON8) Yeah
(PERSON5) I'll switch off the camera just to save bandwidth, camera off.
And there is -
Okay, there is also [PERSON7].
<another_language/>
Does it work?
<another_language/>
(PERSON5) So the we should be muting ourselves, when we are not talking.
(PERSON8) Okay, okay.
(PERSON5) [PERSON8], you can mute yourself, while you are not talking.
Yes, okay.
And I would feel like to hear from [PERSON6] if he is on the call.
Because I see him connected,but I don'tsee him there.
And I don't hear him.
Hm, well, maybe not there, never mind.
Lets - okay, lets get started anyway.
And this call is being recorded because I'm also collecting various meetings.
So I hope that all okay with that been recorded and
and actually we would like to release this publicly,
but with some delay of like this is a so this is not longer interesting.
And there is a good point,
we will send you a link to google form, where you will fill in, that you agree, what this <unintelligible/> to be used and there you can specify the limit,what <unintelligible/>would like this-which you require to be,
em, to be followed before the data is released.
Okay, so, thanks a lot for coming.
You all know this document, the surge 2020 organization.
This is just the envelope.
The more important document is the [PROJECT2] <unintelligible/> topics.
And another document, which is now becoming very important,will be this google sheet, with all the things, that that you have done.
And the the point of these meetings,
and I would really like to have every week.
Next week it should be on Thursdayand then until the end of exam period it would be Thursdays
and then we will vote all again, what is the best day.
The purpose of these meetings is for everybody to say,what they are working on,
and what they have in mind for the upcoming weeks,
and the reason is for me to collect this credits.
This is important.
So whatever you don't sell to me or not getting any bonus for.
Remember that.
And also, we must synchronize ourselves because no there more people doing the same thing.
So for examplenow, [PERSON7], are you on the call?
Can you confirm that you can hear us?
(PERSON7) Well, I am on the call,but I have a lot of problem understanding you so.
(PERSON5) Yes, I'm talking too fast I guessand the microphone is not perfect.
Yeah.
So the point of the call is to make sure,that people know, what others are doing,
and they nicely, well like a collaborate, in the sense that no work is done twice.
And no data is is downloaded twice and so one.
So we have now, also [PERSON10] here, he is going to -
(PERSON10) Bring a chair.
(PERSON5) Yes, to bring a chair.
And so the -
So, the -
So right now,I would like everybody to go like one by one and summarize in a minute or 2,
what you have been working on this week.
And everybody should very carefully listen to this and see any possible synergy.
So I've asked a number of people for now to download the [ORGANIZATION1] database data.
This has to be downloaded only once obviously and has to be convert to plain text only once.
So so who- whoever does that,please let everybody else, know.
And this a- and it's similar.
So after we do this summary of activities,there are being worked on, or finalized,
then we can spend the rest of the the half hour for planning,
what is the most important next thingand who would like to pick up for.
But there is also less importance.
More important is to avoid duplicating our work.
Yeah, so, well, I I'm not working on anything specific myself.
I'm just starting.
I'm just telling people what to do.
So I think that I should not -
Well, I can give you very brief, thin, brief summary.
So there is the again, university open day, next Wednesday,
for which we are doing domain adaptationand then there will be on the 12th of February a dry run of the workshop,that we are going to give for the [ORGANIZATION1] congress.
So that is two and half hours of hands on experience with natural language processing tools.
5 colleagues at least from [ORGANIZATION7], going to the [ORGANIZATION5] officesand presenting these NLP technologies.
And we would do again like this subtitled.
It will be held in English.
The domain of competition fix, that there is tools.
So that will be the next event,for which we should like try the domain adaptation surge again.
So this is important for you [PERSON7].
In the sense -
so, so after [PERSON1]'s tool,the next occasion to test things is the- is this English given presentations of the tools.
If we don't manage to adapt our systems, that's not too important.
We will be recording the session anyway.
There will be one more of session,and then there will be one more dry run.
And there will be the final session on on the [ORGANIZATION2],or at the [ORGANIZATION2].
So for the February of 12th, we can live with current models.
But if we have something adapted for <unintelligible/> this domain, then even better.
So this is my summary.
Then quickly in the the semester, the Monday seminars will start again.
And we could again use it.
Which of that domain adaptation practice.
Yeah, so, that's from me.
So I don't know, maybe we should just follow in a circle.
So t- the important thing is,whether the people remotely present,
can confirm, that they've understood at least something.
(PERSON8) Yes, so, I can confirm, that I've understood everything, what [PERSON5] said and I write them.
And if you guys want,
I can say, what I have been doing like since a week.
(PERSON5) Okay, Yes.
(PERSON8) Or what I plan to do next week.
Okay, So, last week, I started do transcribing the YouTube videos.
That was shared by [PERSON10].
So the English transcriptions are done.
And the Czech I I'll do like today, or I'll start it tomorrow.
The next thing, that I spent last week, like the weekends preparing transcript for the Monday seminar.
And also into getting the [PERSON6]'s ASR, followed by segmenter.
And I also did a voice domain adaptation and <unintelligible/> domain adaptation
and talk adaptation and speaking of the words.
Speaking of the words and the common of the words and substituting them in the dictionary.
But I realized, this for one them properly because I- because it was <unintelligible/>.
So I feel needed to <unintelligible/> was not <unintelligible/> properly.
So this is something, I need to recollect again.
And try it to work next time.
The next thing, I did, there was preparation of the English segmenter.
And the next task, which I need to focus on is the
Because I observed some terrible <unintelligible/> scores onone form, which is the period.
So I need to focus more on sentence, boundary detection on both English and Czech segmenter.
Things I need to do, is in-coming days, integrate [PERSON9]'s audio compression on these YouTube videos.
And progress more on the [PERSON3] 36 36 empty models and doc translation, and basically like <unintelligible/> that [PERSON12]
so that the work is not duplicated again, as more on their size.
And, yeah, and spend more time on integrating <unintelligible/> office <unintelligible/> and text additions from [PERSON4].
So that's it from me.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
So who you <unintelligible/> I misheard <unintelligible/> about the models.
So what what is your plan with the English 36 models?
What exactly do <unintelligible/> ?
(PERSON8) So, exactly like I I I lost some I do not do that.
There was not documentation.
I've been would hope to going their have been some hard to use the them.
So he sent me some instructions and I've been to follow that.
Yeah, so,<unintelligible/>
I've to be <unintelligible/> that the work is not duplicated.
(PERSON5) Yeah, I see.
Okay, so, your goal is to get [ORGANIZATION4] models used in our pipelines.
(PERSON8) Yeah
(PERSON5) Yeah, okay.
And there is one more person to synchronize on what the launching of these models
and that's [PERSON3].
(PERSON8) Okay, so, I <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) [PERSON3] successfully managed to run these models,and he is developing.
He is using the models for the paraphrasing.
(PERSON8) Okay.
So he is successful <unintelligible/>.
I should pick up his hand to give them one medium.
(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON8) Or or maybe our <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) [PERSON12], or [PERSON3] or <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON8) Yeah.
(PERSON5) Okay, thank you.
(PERSON8) Thank you, okay.
<cough/>
(PERSON5) So now we can <unintelligible/>[PERSON4].
Are you?
(PERSON4) Yeah.
So I've already, I am
My work include this document.
So recently, I downloaded some new corpora of interpret spoken language.
So it's a EPIC [ORGANIZATION6] interpretation corpus and [ORGANIZATION6]-ST.
These are corpora created by us.
And I'm trying to do your part, and I'm downloading all of plenary session from your parliament since July 2018.
And 1.7 terabytes of audios, videos interpreting in 22 languages.
And it's a lot of work to process them.
These <unintelligible/> individual speeches, and so so I am not doing any further work from this.
And I I was mailing  with your webmasters, cause they were complaining, that I used there website too much.
(PERSON5) <laugh/>
(PERSON4) And they suggested, that they they implement a feature for mass mass downloading. 
And I I asked them to to enable to create such corpora, together with with transcriptions and interpretations 
and I don't have any -
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/> response. 
(PERSON4) Any response yet so.
So I don't feel I even this, but will be <unintelligible/>.
My main project, until 6th of March is is is multi-source spoken language translation research.
And I bring it for English and German into Czech.
(PERSON5) Yeah, so.
(PERSON4) So I'm starting.
(PERSON5) Yeah, so, this meetings are especially for the [ORGANIZATION1] event.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON5) So what you have described, can very much help that
because all the data that you have gathered, would be used to retrain the ASR models.
So, that's an important thing.
So that people, we do not have [PERSON11] and unsure if
[PERSON6], are you on the call or not?
(PERSON6) Yeah, I somehow managed to get here, but I have some problems with with hear to hear you.
I do not know why because -
(PERSON5) Yes.
(PERSON6) But now, now it's okay.
Now it's okay.
(PERSON5) Yes, so, it depends where I am if I'm on the correct side of the microphone, or not perhaps, as well.
So so the the data that [PERSON4] mentioned, these can be used for all the models, that we are training ourselves
and which also like talk to others, [ORGANIZATION8] to train their models better.
So we need to somehow include them in the surge.
So that they also improve -
They have at least too <unintelligible/> of the model, until the congress.
So that we would perform better.
But [PERSON4]'s main goal until the Feb 6th deadline is to experiment with multiple <other_noise/> translation.
And if this is successful, if we see an improvement from the additional sources,
then this is something, which we would directly use in the surge afterwards.
And there will be a requirement for [PERSON8] to have the pipelines ready.
So that -
We have process multi-source and create English by integrating the many sources.
So this is until this  until this until we choose some us- some utility,
we do not consider it a requirement, or we are not planning to to run multi-source translation at the event.
But if it is if it works, then then it would be great contribution.
Okay, thank you.
(PERSON4) My last part is that I started to do the binding worker for automatic speech recognition and mediator. 
So we can connect JASPER and and  Kaldi to mediator.
So we won't need to connect them separately as as well.
(PERSON5) Okay <other_noise/>.
(PERSON4) <other_noise/> to this.
(PERSON9) So I've already collaborate <unintelligible/> with [PERSON8] for the compression thing. 
(PERSON5) Okay.
(PERSON9) And this week, I was working on the [PROJECT1] thing.
(PERSON5) So is it - ? 
If we tested <unintelligible/> ?
(PERSON9) I- I don't know the efficiency.
The [PERSON8] is not given me any updates of that like the efficiency of that.
So I except that I was working on the like the [PROJECT1] thing, trying to clear on with it.
And this waiting for the data.
As you said from [PERSON3].
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>
So what the what the compression? 
So [PERSON8], can you tell us, h- how -
If you manage to test the compression, that hopefully was somehow proposed by [PERSON9].
And- and do you manage to test it?
What -
How much <unintelligible/> ?
(PERSON8) So [PERSON9] has differently updated me the <unintelligible/> the compression, and but I am -
I was unable -
I didn't find time to deal it with the current- my current pipeline.
Because I was s- I spent like last weekend on preparing for the Monday seminar.
And audio compression was not on me  focus for the Monday.
So probably, maybe I coming 1, 2 days, that should be integrated.
And I'll be sharing our statistics and how much laws are we able to -
(PERSON5) Make.
(PERSON8) Come up with <unintelligible/> compression.
(PERSON5) So another option would be to tell [PERSON9], how to run it.
So that [PERSON9] could connect to the mediator and test it test it himself.
So if that would be easier for you,
instead of evaluating it for [PERSON9] to update a review that works for some of the setups
[PERSON9] [PERSON9] would check out the crews control, do the set up from his laptop and connect to his laptop,
with his laptop connected to wired connection  and evaluating the the ASR quality with compression, or without compression
That's another option.
(PERSON8) I completely agree with you.
So what I am going to do next, is that we can take a- any of the Monday seminar revised transcript 
and we can to take that as a test set,
and we can do as uncompressed and check the word error rate,
and  we can do a compressed pipeline and again check the word error rate
and let's see, how it goes, so here we got some propose.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
But what what I'm proposing is, that not you, but [PERSON9] would do this.
(PERSON8) Yeah, exactly, [PERSON9] [PERSON9] exactly, yeah. 
So I I'm going to instruct all these to [PERSON9], yeah.
(PERSON5) Yeah, so that [PERSON9] runs this.
And I would like to see the evaluation in two ways.
One without mediator being involved, if that is possible.
That is -
(PERSON8) Okay, okay.
(PERSON5) That is not possible for the - 
No, no, no it is not possible for [PERSON9] to do because he - 
(PERSON8) Yeah, exactly <unintelligible/> yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/> systems.
So so we could do it via the mediator.
And that is more important.
(PERSON8) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON5) So start with this this one only.
Okay?
(PERSON8) Okay.
(PERSON5) A thing, that [PERSON9] was talking about -
(PERSON9) <unintelligible/> to collaborate with [PERSON4] and what we did.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
Yeah, but that's for the other purpose.
It's not for not for the [ORGANIZATION1] Congress.
(PERSON9) Yeah.
(PERSON5) Okay, so it's there anything in your plans from the surge,
like what is going to directly help the [ORGANIZATION1] Congress?
(PERSON9) As of know I'll be ready to interest like  for example, the compression
because the bandwidth is, an issue there.
So for example, if the compression is not really effecting  the ASR output that that should be a really good thing.
And I think <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) I meant in the in the document of Monday test, there is a list of wanted things.
(PERSON9) Yes, yes.
(PERSON5) So if you don't have any any immediate thing to try, then have a look
and tell me, which which topic you would like to work  on.
(PERSON9) <laugh/> sure.
(PERSON5) Okay, thank you.
Yeah.
(PERSON2) Okay, so now, I'm working on the framework or for example test set for evaluation of simultaneous translation.
Where can we have audio file and we want to translate it to s- to the target language.
And I wanted to propose some ideas.
Some of them are novel, some of them- not because they are were represented before.
For calculating the delay, BLEU score and <unintelligible/>, all of them.
I know, into the end yesterday, maybe no one account working on because we had a problem of segmentation.
As you know, for example the segmentation in the difference part, could should shouldn't necessary - 
Is the same as the segmentation.
But empty my sheet, empty output prepared.
So I we had a problem of segmentation, when we wanted to calculate delay.
So I decided from yesterday to do to to propose a new idea.
Because using there <unintelligible/> segmenter.
We can segment both of them, but the problem is, when we want to calculate delay.
Sometimes it has, some words are repeated more than once and it could make some problem.
So now, in our tool set, I want to report who define delay.
One segmenter based on time, exactly on the time, when they set us.
And I report this delay.
And also the delay based on the MWAR segmenter.
So now, I want to propose both se- both of them and so maybe <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/> 
So let me comment on this.
So this this worrying that [PERSON2] is doing, is generally preparations for the SLT shared task.
So that we have a reliable tool to evaluate submissions in the shared task.
And the shared task, that we are running at IWSLT is directly aimed to help [PROJECT2] in the [ORGANIZATION1] Congress.
So the domain will include -
The data set will include our domain and and all that.
But I would like to somehow even further, or be on this IWSLT shared task.
The evaluation script of [PERSON2] to be used in this surge, in this in this gradual improvement of our systems.
So this is something for [PERSON8].
I would like [PERSON2] and [PERSON8] to get directly in in contact.
And [PERSON8] to provide [PERSON2] with some output files as transcribed <unintelligible/>
And the reference transcripts, so that you can test the tool.
It will be like testing booth.
It will be testing the performance of our base-line system and measuring <unintelligible/>.
and it will be testing your tool, whether it evaluates the the files correctly.
So so the- there is like three people, that will work together very closely.
That, one is [PERSON8], who has the access to the pipelines.
And [PERSON10], who will know everything about the data.
And [PERSON2], who knows everything about the evaluation.
And I would like regularly to have like measurements of the ASR, end-to-end, quality, delay, and flicker.
In the- on the systems, that are integrated <unintelligible/>.
So that is that is the immediate help,
that that your work will will provide to the to the [ORGANIZATION1] Congress.
(PERSON2) Okay, it will be -
(PERSON5) Yeah, so [PERSON8] is [PERSON8] is in India until end of January, is arriving in early February.
So it's not going to help us with the- with submission and prepare afterwards. 
(PERSON2) Yes.
(PERSON5) And it would be great, if you could set up -
(PERSON2) Exactly.
(PERSON5) A regular evaluation of our pipelines.
(PERSON2) Just we have some intermediate data to test our framework, 
 and it's our papers, so we have it before that.
Yes, it's could be caused after start, which and I can have a- <unintelligible/> which can I have a meeting with [PERSON8],
and we can test everything <unintelligible/> so.
(PERSON5) Yeah, okay.
Thank you.
(PERSON2) Thank you very much.
(PERSON8) Can [PERSON2] and all of <unintelligible/>?
Yeah, okay, thank you.
(PERSON5) Yeah, so the next one is [PERSON12].
(PERSON12) <laugh/> in the la -
In this weekend, last week, I worked on data collection to find the data,
where is labeled of <unintelligible/> 42 languages especially  for monolingual languages.
So I have I have already shared with with [PERSON5] and [PERSON10] and [PERSON9] to <unintelligible/>.
There is a -
A link is already available.
In the one link is <unintelligible/> in the one link 22 languages data available.
It's like a monolingual.
We can see monolingual,
but <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Okay.
<unintelligible/>
So neither  do I <unintelligible/>.
<laugh/> I just -
Okay.
(PERSON12) It' a <unintelligible/> the name of this <unintelligible/>.
Okay.
I'm just scared now, where is the link?
 Okay.
 It's a <unintelligible/>.
Sorry.
European <unintelligible/> of auditors web site <unintelligible/>.
42 languages, 42 European languages.
(PERSON5) You know something about some excel, that you sent to us? 
(PERSON12) Yes.
(PERSON5) Or, what what is that?
Can you - ?
<unintelligible/> 
<other_noise/>
(PERSON12) <unintelligible/>
So maybe, maybe it's <unintelligible/> anyone so we can edit.
<unintelligible/> edited.
And then copy and send it by plain mail because I also didn't receive that.
That so google is not sharing the properly -
(PERSON12) Okay, so I'm hoping <unintelligible/>.
<unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) What?
(PERSON12) <unintelligible/>
<other_noise/>
So, okay.
(PERSON5) Yes so so you are scanning the websites.
(PERSON12) Yes.
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>.
And maybe others  list it in the Google sheet.
(PERSON12) Yes.
I have also searched the parallel data that I ignored the <unintelligible/>
because most of the data is available <unintelligible/> of the other six languages.
And <unintelligible/> we require it [ORGANIZATION1] Congress.
And we had 7 languages so -
(PERSON5) The Italian is not -
(PERSON12) Yeah, Italian is not included, so I exclude Italian.
So German, French, Spanish, English, Czech.
And so it is already mentioned,  but we need to download all the PDF documents.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
On this -
So now [PERSON7], can you hear us?
[PERSON7], can you hear us?
(PERSON7) Yes, I can. 
(PERSON5) Yeah, so I think, now it is very important,
that you and [PERSON12] will synchronize on the thing tools
because both's you and [PERSON12] need to convert all the many file formats,
especially PDFs, that are hard to process <unintelligible/>.
And you both have some tools for that and you also, both of you need to convert it to corpus styles.
So one sentence per line.
And if it's parallel text, then -
That's that is not for you [PERSON7], but that would be for [PERSON12] to aline in that <unintelligible/> more sentences and so on.
But getting from random file formats to the sentence oriented plain text, is something which both of you have to do.
And it would be a big pitty, if you did it twice.
So please, be in touch.
You needs it differently, like the way [PERSON7] needs it is for smaller sets of files
and more or less interactively.
The way [PERSON12] needs it is is to have it parallelizable on the on the cluster,
so that you can process a huge collections of files.
So the this setup is slightly different.
But still, the underlying tools would be would be the same.
So please, stay in close touch.
So you use both <unintelligible/> Tokenizer <unintelligible/>.
[PERSON7] and I don't know, what [PERSON12] use -
(PERSON12) I use <unintelligible/> for this <unintelligible/>.
For PDF text convertor <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Yeah, I don't I don't -
So so yes, so simply -
(PERSON12) I've been- I have already sent two PDF files -
(PERSON5) Uhm.
(PERSON12) to you and -
(PERSON5) Yeah.
(PERSON12) everyone.
(PERSON5) Yeah, so lets work a little bit of evaluation.
Which of the tools is  is easy to use and produces good results?
So [PERSON7], please be in touch with [PERSON12] and make sure, that you both use the best tool.
(PERSON12) <laugh/> 
Yeah because the most of the tool like G- or for German, <unintelligible/> is working fine.
(PERSON5) Uhm.
(PERSON12) And work the for <unintelligible/> gives really bad <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Yeah, okay, so It could be language dependent.
(PERSON12) Yeah, language dependent.
So I think we can use different tool like every word is a word <unintelligible/> can works PDF <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Yeah, Yeah.
And all these are Linux based.
(PERSON12) Yes -
(PERSON5) All they can be run -
(PERSON12) And anyone -
(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah, okay, that's good.
So [PERSON7], please, confirm again, that the voice was good, that you understood us.
(PERSON7) Well, I understood only a part of thing, 
but I will get in touch with [PERSON12] and whatever is needed.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
Yeah, it's it's not only needed, it is it's that what [PERSON12] knows, can help you with your bachelor thesis.
You should benefit from that experience as well.
So it's- it it's mutual- mutually beneficial.
(PERSON7) <laugh/>
(PERSON5) Okay, thank you.
And now we have [PERSON10] here.
(PERSON10) Yeah.
So my job's to to have an overview of all the data, we use for for the [ORGANIZATION1] Congress.
To integrate it and to create test sets, test sets using them.
So so you've <unintelligible/> anyone had some some data source.
<unintelligible/> I have list the whole that all things and I will- I have do a store on the cluster.
So basically, I've I've done <unintelligible/> part cluster overview.
All this- all this things, that we use as a source of data.
And I also worked with with people, which do do the manual work,
or for example creating transcription, translations, or the stuff.
So I am reworking with them giving them tasks to do and <unintelligible/> them, hiring them.
It's cool.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
Not in this thing yet, but later, when -
So so right now [PERSON10] is mainly working on the IWSLT test set, 
or test set  and <unintelligible/> that we have to released.
And these IWSLT, that's spoken language translation from English into two  languages of our interest only.
So only into Czech and German.
And beyond that, [PERSON10] will be also supervising and knowing,
where the pits are for the old language pairs and translation directions,
that we want for the [ORGANIZATION1] Congress.
And once this test set is stabilized.
We would really like to to run the regular evaluation.
So that's, what I was telling earlier,
that [PERSON8] should regularly process the test sets with pipelines
and use the evaluation tool by E- [PERSON2].
And these numbers should be then like a picked up, or collected by [PERSON10].
So that we can know, that all these numbers are comparable in some way.
So by this -
It - 
So [PERSON10] should be collecting, not only the numbers, but the actual outputs of the system.
And doing sanity check of of of the <unintelligible/> as well.
So maybe, it would be [PERSON10], who'll be running the the tool by [PERSON2].
In the end.
Ok.
So we have also [PERSON6] on the call.
So [PERSON6], if you can report work briefly. 
(PERSON6) Yeah, hi,
I've done I've done the forced alignment.
It's the- on the- it's in the repository, in the cruise control, on the -
<another_language/> in the in the folder [ORGANIZATION3] Jasper ASR.
So there's a demo and and some README, which you can check and you can run my ASR.
And you can run the forced alignment. 
And there is- there is also information about- where the - 
where the actual installation is in the cluster
because you have- you have to use custom environment,
Python  environment and Pytorch environment to run my models.
So you can do it only in cluster.
And now, I'm working on on onlinezation of my ASR
because as as you may know, I have problems with with transcribing,
the running window, which cuts the words in the middle
and then the then the language model does strange things,
to to the all words in the whole trans- transcription.
So that's, what I'm currently working on. 
(PERSON5) Yeah, okay, thank you.
So do we have anyone else on the call?
<laugh/>
Doesn't seem so.
So well, time's up.
We were we were 5 minutes -
(PERSON13) <unintelligible/> working- I working back translation.
(PERSON5) Uhm.
(PERSON13) <unintelligible/> so we are running same -
We are going to plan and we are going to implement a back translation in the next week.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
<unintelligible/> So after collecting a data, or before, we can run that and -
Before, like- okay.
We are working on English to Czech languages <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) So well, back trans - 
There is multiple occasions, on which we can we can use these systems.
The first occasion, for which we could try, is the talk by [PERSON1] on Wednesday already.
And then we actually need to find tune systems to be deployed by Wednesday.
I am not sure, if this is feasible, or not.
Even if it's not feasible, to to deploy it by Wednesday,
we need to gather these better models, where the weeks for all the languages.
So ASR all ASR languages to- to the English.
So all the 6, or 7 ASR languages to the English and then from English into all the target languages.
So for that, you need good pipeline. 
So that every week, you will have a new model adapted to this.
So I think, it's to use the the Wednesday opportunity to have better [PROJECT1] systems as as a good thing.
So but there -
Well, I'm telling bet- I'm telling b- saying better [PROJECT1] systems.
<unintelligible/> To English?
(PERSON5) Czech to English.
(PERSON13) Do I fix it?
(PERSON5) So what is the current status of  Czech to English?
<unintelligible/> <unintelligible/> one plan for <unintelligible/> was the <unintelligible/> current of the <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Uhm.
(PERSON13) And I implement it way, how to improve it into the the missing characters.
(PERSON5) Uhm.
(PERSON13) I can reshare this in one day to be f- well, fix the missing characters and improves BLEU by one point.
 One decimal point.
(PERSON5)  One decimal point.
So so right now, in the pipeline we use Czech to English by [PERSON1].
Now.
(PERSON13) We can can use both.
(PERSON5) Yeah, so which did we- which one did we use a last week for, or - ?
(PERSON13) No, maybe it was [ORGANIZATION4].
(PERSON5) Yeah.
<laugh/>
So this is something very important.
We need to know what we are using.
And we need to know, which one of them is is the best.
So there is an important evaluation request.
[PERSON8], could you evaluate on [PERSON1]'s recorded talk?
Which on the - 
Well, we don't have -
That's it.
We have only  the transcript we don't have the translation.
What data set can use for Czech to English?
(PERSON8) We can translate like <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) <other_noise/> <laugh/>.
Bad.
(PERSON8) <laugh/>
(PERSON5) So well, I think, that simply obtain that.
Lets lets do it, lets do just -
(PERSON8) Or <unintelligible/> just thing convert to <unintelligible/> systems.
(PERSON5) Yeah, exactly. 
So please, [PERSON8], in preparation for Wednesday, 
please, process  [PERSON1]'s dry run of the talk.
Would all be Czech to English.
Setups, that you can use, in the pipeline, that are already integrated.
On Monday, we'll interest in in like models, that do text translation, 
we will interested in, what is integrated in our speech processing pipeline.
And please, send as the outputs, or put it to the -
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) [PERSON1]'s folder.
So that will be, that will be -
Get in touch with [PERSON4].
So that you know, which model is is which.
It will be the transformer by [PERSON1], it will be the [PROJECT1] by [PERSON4].
It could be [PROJECT1] by [PERSON4] with the missing letters in it.
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Yeah, if if if [PERSON4] fixes it.
And it could -
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
And it could be and that from my point of view from my point of the of the more important.
It could be [PROJECT1] by [PERSON4], finetuned on the parallel data, that we will create by back translation, 
or maybe we find other parallel data in the domain of competition linguistics.
So I think, that on for example for example on Monday, 
[PERSON8], you could evaluate the existing systems 
and well, I evaluate, I mean, you run them and have the outputs.
We do not have the reference translation.
And on Tuesday, [PERSON4] could <other_noise/> fine tune the system.
And on Wednesday morning, we will decide, whether to d - 
which one to deploy for for the event.
Right?
(PERSON8) It's okay.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON5) But lets lets give it a try <laugh/>.
(PERSON8) Sure, sure, sure.
So one question, do we have some own data on [PERSON1]'s talk?
That we think of <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) We have a source audio, that's the one, that that's [PERSON11] -
It's it's -
I can say you'd path, but I think you you must have the path.
It's the recording, that I have done with [PERSON1] recently.
There is in the domain adaptation 2020 January 29, 
[PERSON1] <other_noise/> there should be there, there is the audio,
and there is the transcript, and [PERSON11] has corrected the transcript manually.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Okay, okay, okay.
(PERSON5) Would you see any <unintelligible/>?
It's about 20 minutes of of audio.
(PERSON8) No, I - 
I I I I haven't I actually have have I haven't open the access <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Yes, okay.
(PERSON8) So far I- I followed this so and I'm I'm <unintelligible/> probably something to progress so.
(PERSON5) Okay.
So I'm the a -
At least, and maybe it is not totally <unintelligible/> of you, but it's clearing my head,
what we should should try with the -
<unintelligible/> translation before this Wednesday.
<parallel_talk/> what the happening? <parallel_talk/>
Okay, So I think, that's- we are 12 minutes beyond out time, let's stop it now.
We could spend months talking on this. 
<laugh/>
So <unintelligible/>. 
(PERSON8) So- Sorry, to interrupt to you [PERSON5].
I I want thing to say to  maybe [PERSON2] and [PERSON4].
I would like to use some in-domain data from -
Like European data to train the segmenter, like English and Czech segmenter
and use [PERSON2]'s evaluation tool to see, how they are doing. 
The  the -
In <unintelligible/>  to the models, we have <unintelligible/> from Czech <unintelligible/>.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON2) Okay, So.
But I think I thnik, that <other_noise/> should be ready -
Okay, I think, the tool should be ready next week. 
(PERSON8) Uhm. 
(PERSON2) They have to be ready <unintelligible/>.
No, no, I  think because it's ready, but every time we have some new assumption. 
(PERSON8) I <unintelligible/> and -
(PERSON2) Yes.
And if I can get the first amount of data and after that, after the some is more test,
I think, that the tool is ready and you can use it. 
(PERSON8) Okay, okay.
Then I I'll use this week maybe to train -
To get in touch with [PERSON4] and get European data to train a new segmenter, without like <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) And I think I'm available next week and whenever you want, we can we can have a meeting together.
And we can -
(PERSON8) Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Yeah, we we can dis- discuss for on this topic, Yeah.
Yeah, this is never-ending.
<laugh/>
(PERSON4) Okay, the next week, I'm not available on Thursday and Friday because -
(PERSON8) Sure, sure, sure.
(PERSON4) I am -
(PERSON8) Okay, okay, okay.
No problem.
(PERSON5) Yeah, okay.
So well, the next week, I'm also not available on Friday.
So whoever is available, we'll meet on Thursday
and we have the the session on on Wednesday. 
Okay.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot to all.
If there no further questions and no further comments then -
(PERSON2) Thank you.
() Thank's.
() Bye, bye.
<unintelligible/>.
(PERSON8) Ciao, good night.
(PERSON5) Yeah, <laugh/>.
<laugh/>.
