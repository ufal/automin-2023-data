(PERSON5) 1, 2, 3, 4 there was the pin, but it's also your net <unintelligible>. And I would feel like to hear from [PERSON6] if he is on the call. And this call is being recorded because I'm also collecting various meetings. And another document, which is now becoming very important,will be this google sheet, with all the things, that that you have done. And the the point of these meetings,
and I would really like to have every week. So whatever you don't sell to me or not getting any bonus for. And also, we must synchronize ourselves because no there more people doing the same thing. So the point of the call is to make sure,that people know, what others are doing,
and they nicely, well like a collaborate, in the sense that no work is done twice. This has to be downloaded only once obviously and has to be convert to plain text only once. So that will be the next event,for which we should like try the domain adaptation surge again. If we don't manage to adapt our systems, that's not too important. So t- the important thing is,whether the people remotely present,
can confirm, that they've understood at least something. Okay, So, last week, I started do transcribing the YouTube videos. And the Czech I I'll do like today, or I'll start it tomorrow. The next thing, that I spent last week, like the weekends preparing transcript for the Monday seminar. Speaking of the words and the common of the words and substituting them in the dictionary. So he sent me some instructions and I've been to follow that. Yeah, so,<unintelligible>
I've to be <unintelligible> that the work is not duplicated. <other_cough>
(PERSON5) So now we can <unintelligible>[PERSON4]. And I I was mailing  with your webmasters, cause they were complaining, that I used there website too much. So that they also improve -
They have at least too <unintelligible> of the model, until the congress. (PERSON4) My last part is that I started to do the binding worker for automatic speech recognition and mediator. (PERSON9) And this week, I was working on the [PROJECT1] thing. (PERSON5) So another option would be to tell [PERSON9], how to run it. Some of them are novel, some of them- not because they are were represented before. We can segment both of them, but the problem is, when we want to calculate delay. Sometimes it has, some words are repeated more than once and it could make some problem. One segmenter based on time, exactly on the time, when they set us. But I would like to somehow even further, or be on this IWSLT shared task. It will be testing the performance of our base-line system and measuring <unintelligible>. That, one is [PERSON8], who has the access to the pipelines. In the- on the systems, that are integrated <unintelligible>. (PERSON5) And it would be great, if you could set up -
(PERSON2) Exactly. (PERSON2) Just we have some intermediate data to test our framework, 
 and it's our papers, so we have it before that. (PERSON12) <laugh> in the la -
In this weekend, last week, I worked on data collection to find the data,
where is labeled of <unintelligible> 42 languages especially  for monolingual languages. (PERSON12) <other_unrecognisable speech="">
<other_noise>
So, okay. (PERSON12) And work the for <unintelligible> gives really bad <unintelligible>. Yeah, it's it's not only needed, it is it's that what [PERSON12] knows, can help you with your bachelor thesis. To integrate it and to create test sets, test sets using them. So basically, I've I've done <unintelligible> part cluster overview. So that's, what I was telling earlier,
that [PERSON8] should regularly process the test sets with pipelines
and use the evaluation tool by E- [PERSON2]. (PERSON13) <unintelligible> so we are (running) same -
We are going to plan and we are going to implement a back translation in the next week. And then we actually need to find tune systems to be deployed by Wednesday. Even if it's not feasible, to to deploy it by Wednesday,
we need to gather these better models, where the weeks for all the languages. <unintelligible> <unintelligible> one plan for <unintelligible> was the <unintelligible> current of the <unintelligible>. (PERSON8) <laugh>
(PERSON5) So well, I think, that simply obtain that. And it could be and that from my point of view from my point of the of the more important. So I think, that on for example for example on Monday, 
[PERSON8], you could evaluate the existing systems 
and well, I evaluate, I mean, you run them and have the outputs. No, no, I  think because it's ready, but every time we have some new assumption. So whoever is available, we'll meet on Thursday
and we have the the session on on Wednesday.
