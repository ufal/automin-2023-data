  - Disc: He is interested in putting together the censorship pipeline after PROJECT4. 
* PERSON3 is unable to respond in time to a technical call on the disabling of the outputs of the life editing tool. 
* He suggests a call between PERSON12, PERSON14, PERSON10, PERSON15, and maybe [PONENTHAN] and the second lost person. 
* PERSON4's task is to generate synthetic multi-source train set. 
  - Fact: The paperwork is still in the process. 
  - Fact: When he gets the cluster access, he will check if the paperwork is already processed enough and write the training instructions for the model he is supposed to train. 
* PERSON4 wants to have access to the system and cluster so he can do something with it. 
  - Fact: It's two GPUs per machine, so it's not for 8, but for larger ones. 
  - Disc: The memory of the cluster is full, like this cluster is. 
* It is hard to receive more than one GPU there. PERSON11, PERSON4, PERSON10 and PERSON10 will wait for their cluster to arrive. It's hard to get more than 1 GPU there". 
* PERSON10 and PERSON15 should be working on the multilingual PROJECT4 systems now. 
* They will discuss it directly after the call with PERSON3. 
  - Fact: PERSON10 will send them the summary of the current summary and send them how they do data collection in ORGANIZATION15. 
* PERSON7 is working on data data augmentation for PROJECT4. His model is only for offline processing. 
  - Disc: If his model works well, it will be integrated into PROJECT5's test set. The best person to help him with the onlinezation of his model would probably be PERSON10. 
* PERSON7, Peter and Umar will use the CTC end-to-end model or the cascaded model from PERSON7's thesis. 
  -- Disc: The evaluation of the offline runs is the deciding thing. 
  - Disc: They will ask Umar to work on the same data and keep training.

  - Disc: PERSON10 has an idea for a new training system. 
* PERSON10 suggests transfer learning on on of double encoder model on small GPus. 
  - Fact: If they have trained model for English-Czech and German-C Czech, then you can try to copy the parameters from one encoder to the other one from one model. 
* PERSON3 recommends to always try it with small models and small data first and then apply it to the large data. He suggests to send the code to PERSON10 by e-mail.

* PERSON7 is working on a project called ORGANIZATION11. He's trying to improve the robustness of the Common Voice speech data set. 
* He wants to use non-native speakers' words more frequently. He also wants to create wholly new sentences instead of training end to end. 
* PERSON7 is working on the same task which was due to the ORGANIZATION14 challenge. He doesn't know the exact statistics of the task. 
* He needs to check the details. 
  - Disc: He didn't understand the instructions because he didn't know what the task was.

* The main objective of PROJECT7 is to train a robust English in order to be able to communicate with PROJECT4 more effectively. The main objective is to develop a more robust English to the more difficult to understand language. The training is aimed at developing a more fluent English. 
* PERSON7 is using the ORGANIZATION4 toolkit. Next week he will be in Prague and he will start to work on the multi-lingual project. He is still at home and he doesn't have much time to work now.
