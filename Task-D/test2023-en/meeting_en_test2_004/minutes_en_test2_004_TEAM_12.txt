okay it seems that i like i need to disconnect first and then reconnect so okay. so now i'm actually back to work and that actually improved my mood. and my holidays were also not kind of like that fun. but that was still fun stuff so you cannot complain. okay so let's get started because we want to cut this shortest topic uh so yeah. um i've started documents with to do lists. but i would like to ask anyone who could help.
