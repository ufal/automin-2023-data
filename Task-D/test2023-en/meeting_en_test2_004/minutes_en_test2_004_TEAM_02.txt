i'm not really sure that if one has a income membership, they will get reduced three restrictions.
so i would ask [PERSON96] at [ORGANIZATION5] how many people potentially could take part in their speech.
i wasted my holidays by being ill, but that was not not covid related.
now i'm actually back to work and that actually improved my mood..
i'm sending a question to [PERSON14] now.
i'm going to the [PROJECT6] tomorrow for a technical meeting.
i'm going to see where can we plug our bear ringers and actually record the sound..
cnn's john sutter has been asked to explain the web-based weights and biases solution.
sutter is working on updating the demo paper submission.
he's also gathering documents, ah, not the documents themselves, for the two sessions..
ah, probably no progress over the christmas.
profanity filtering should be added to complimentary metric, uh, actually it is more.
(PERSON7) i think of the one point five, uh, and what you were unhappy about..
cnn's john sutter has compiled a dictionary of rare words.
it could be used as part of the second thing of the railroad.
sutter: we need to improve our segmenter..
cnn's john sutter asks loud if he can get some delay scores for a single document.
sutter: "i'm i'm happy with the tables that we put into the deliverables" "i really do want to have tha observations being gathered throughout the weeks and not for the deadline".
mhm is trying to train the a model on common voice.
mhm's answer is definitely more datasets.
mhm has sent an email to people asking about links to the data..
cnn's john sutter wants to use the common voice for a baseline.
but he thinks it would be too small for comparison purposes.
sutter also wants to use some more frequently used datasets..
i think the sooner i get started working on it the sooner i will be able to build the system.
i'm actually also like to work on the non native speakers, uh, uh, of my thesis.
i'm also thinking to do some non native speech, uh, as a part of the masters thesis..
i'm more fan of the of the of the of the unintelligible> models.
i will probably talk to [PERSON10] on monday or tuesday.
i have a model for czech, german and english which works on youtube videos..
i'm going to integrate it into the mediator and create one s simple start up script to increase control so anyone can use it.
and then i'm going to analyze the asi dev unintelligible> data and then probably [PROJECT12] training or anything else.
and one topic is missing.
and that is the, uh, study.
subtitler study where we are aiming towards [ORGANIZATION8] deadline..
cnn's jarrett bellini looks at how to integrate multilingual models.
he says it's not necessary to have multiple concurrent inputs.
if it is a [PROJECT12]- uh, it is not [PROJECT12], uh, by having multiple concurrent inputs.
bellini: if it's a [PROJECT9]- uh, it's not [PROJECT12], uh, by having multiple concurrent inputs .
mhm: i don't think, it should deteriorate too much if it's uh, three languages.
if you have good data for the language pair, then yes, it is better to go directly.
but if your data is more available through english then it's better to go through english..
