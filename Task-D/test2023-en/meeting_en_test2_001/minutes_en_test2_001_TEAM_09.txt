And whose-

(PERSON5) Oh, ok.

(PERSON4) [PERSON2] is not coming?(PERSON4) Aha, she is ill.

(PERSON5) Yea, yeah, yeah, right.(PERSON4) Oh yey, what is, is it Covid?(PERSON5) Oh, [PERSON2] joined.(PERSON4) Yeah, [PERSON2] joined.(PERSON2) Oh, actually I 'm-

(PERSON4) Oh, yey.(PERSON2) <unintelligible> since-

(PERSON5) <unintelligible> list maybe <unintelligible>.(PERSON2) Yeah, anyway was just lying down I can hear-

I'm getting bored actually now.To, [PERSON4] do you have anything specific to discuss today?(PERSON5) Ok, so [PERSON4] I was like looking through the task that we need to do.So, Ah I have connected to the person whom [PERSON6] reffered.And he reverted to me back with a link and say that you can do it there.So I'm get to see that how it looks like to do with the [ORGANIZATION1], ah, website.What I was wondering like if we can quickly do it on a Github or something.So, let me first look into that um, like, how does it works, uh, to do with <unintelligible> and something.<unintelligible> do it in Github and do it very quickly.(PERSON5) <unintelligible> like do much more timing to, into these things.So one thing is setting up the website, but the website should have, uh, the content like, ah, the call for participations.(PERSON4) So the website of Ah, the <unintelligible>, of the, of the special event.Like, let me write it first version, and then, um, like maybe you, [PERSON2] and [PERSON6] should comment on that.Yeah, so I will share with both of you a <unintelligible> e-mail for that we will resending to people we know and we want to-

(PERSON4) I don't know-

I don't have any, I don't have any connections in this summarization field.(PERSON5) No, no, not require, not require [PERSON4], not require to like only for summarization, ok?(PERSON4) But how-

(PERSON5) We have to show we have a good program committee.(PERSON5) Like no one is going to check, you know.<laugh>

(PERSON5) Yeah.(PERSON4) They will know that they are good, but at the same time they will not know that they are summarization people.So even big and like agree to do uh review at least one or two papers.(PERSON5) You can just ask them, because eventually, like finally, it depends on how many papers we are getting.And then we can invite more people based on how many papers we are getting, okay?So that is <unintelligible>  requirement, but for in the website we have to show at least, I will say approximately around more than 20 people in the program committee.So like we have many good uh contexts, like, for example, from [ORGANIZATION1] only we can have two or more than three or four people.(PERSON5) And so let us let me write the draft e-mail and share it with you.Just Google Docs is kind of uh it does not work today.(PERSON4) I don't know, but [PERSON6] told that today Google doesn't work.<laugh>

(PERSON5) Yes, I can also see that.Uh so the thing is like a for the website we need this thing uh to be ready.So, he is yet to respond back that we should do the individual membership, or we should do institutional membership so that we have to know what to do.(PERSON4) I think I 'm a little bit lost and <unintelligible>.(PERSON5) Yeah, so we have to also like get the <unintelligible> membership right.So uh for that, I have mail to that-

(PERSON4) Aha, okay, I see on my <unintelligible>, ok.

(PERSON5) And I was looking at the, into some challenges of for the last year and their websites.(PERSON4) Ok.

(PERSON5) Wait for the draft and, yeah.And uh maybe like uh, I will also copy on to it so that he can also invite some more people into the program committee.(PERSON4) Definitely, definitely um copy to [PERSON6].Because, yes he is the person who could have know about somebody.Uh it seems a lot of work to do.Because, you know, like um, usually in workshop, like we used to have a big organizing committee, and some people are from <unintelligible>.None of us from-

You're also, you're also not from the summarization background?So that is, anyway, I did not thought like, um, like making a share task would be that much challenging.Well, I <unintelligible> that it is challenging since why I was so much unsure about making workshop that.(PERSON5) Yeah, the actually, like we are also doing uh some workshops with <unintelligible>.But I, like I am mostly looking into the like publicity and the website.And also a bit on writing the paper uh for that uh, but I did not like, um, <unintelligible> share task I guess it there is so many things that we need to take care of.So that is why we have to focus on-

(PERSON4) Yes, we don't have, we don't, we don't actually have scientific input.(PERSON5) Yes and I believe, like if to make it a workshop we definitely need at least one or two people who have a background in summarization.Because originally, we planned and make a work, a shirt task.It means to give the participants a totally new task and asked them to make mixed experiment and then compare the results.I really, I can 't help beat frustrated how it is it is possible to do.(PERSON5) Yeah, I think uh like uh, even if we call it a workshop, but it will be mostly challenge specific.But it is also actually not a workshop it's a satellite event.At the satellite event maybe <unintelligible>

(PERSON5) Right, right, that's the exact word.<unintelligible> not call it a workshop.(PERSON4) Yes, let's not call it a workshop.Uh so, but uh like they did not like, they didn't like responded affordably so they were actually not available.(PERSON5) Yes, yes, many, me and [PERSON6] we, we addressed at least six to seven people from summarization community.(PERSON5) But they are very, like they are very famous professors, including [PERSON3], <unintelligible> and-

(PERSON4) And they did not answer?(PERSON5) No, they did answer, but they said, they were very busy.(PERSON4) Aha, ok.

(PERSON5) But the thing is that we <unintelligible> to like the like what unquote very famous people from some relation who were like, you know.(PERSON5) No, I 'm going to ask him to be a part of the program committee because he declined to be a part of the organizing committee.(PERSON4) Yeah, <unintelligible> is definitely a good idea.He should be, if he agrees, he is a good part of an organizing committee.But feel uh [ORGANIZATION3] is is organizer, so it does not make sense, like someone from [ORGANIZATION1], right?(PERSON5) As a <unintelligible> does it make sense like someone from [ORGANIZATION1] to deliver the keynote?So if it is somebody, why not if it could be, if it is an authoritative person who knows about the topic, but I do not know the person.(PERSON4) As as I think about summarization, I knew just a couple of very young students who began to do the year.Mm, so let me ask, let me ask [PERSON6] <unintelligible>.(PERSON4) Should I, should you, do you want to ask him now?(PERSON5) Ok.

(PERSON4) No, he's in the next room.(PERSON5) I think just let me-

(PERSON4) Ok, let <unintelligible>, write him an e-mail, yes.(PERSON5) Yes, I try to figure out what are the other things that we need to take care of.(PERSON5) Yeah, <unintelligible>, ok, bye.
