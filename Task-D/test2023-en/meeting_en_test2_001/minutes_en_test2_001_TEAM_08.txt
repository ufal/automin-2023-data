(PERSON4) In [LOCATION1] it is quite bad, but I do not know what is bad. What I was wondering like if we can quickly do it on a Github or something. So, let me first look into that um, like, how does it works, uh, to do with <unintelligible> and something. Yeah, so I will share with both of you a <unintelligible> e-mail for that we will resending to people we know and we want to-

(PERSON4) I don't know-

I don't have any, I don't have any connections in this summarization field. (PERSON4) But how-

(PERSON5) We have to show we have a good program committee. And uh like uh we have to have the membership <unintelligible>. So these are the, like, immediate pending task for preparing the proposals. Well, I <unintelligible> that it is challenging since why I was so much unsure about making workshop that. Because originally, we planned and make a work, a shirt task. It means to give the participants a totally new task and asked them to make mixed experiment and then compare the results. (PERSON5) And for the like <unintelligible> speakers also like we have to invite some <unintelligible> for the input. Uh so, but uh like they did not like, they didn't like responded affordably so they were actually not available. He should be, if he agrees, he is a good part of an organizing committee. So if it is somebody, why not if it could be, if it is an authoritative person who knows about the topic, but I do not know the person. Actually I do not know about senior people for just summarization. (PERSON5) Ehm, I can e-mail him or how do you propose to ask him? (PERSON5) So if he is available maybe he can, would he be able to join? (PERSON5) I think just let me-

(PERSON4) Ok, let <unintelligible>, write him an e-mail, yes. (PERSON5) Yes, I try to figure out what are the other things that we need to take care of.
