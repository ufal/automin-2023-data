Date: 14. 09. 2020
Attendees: [PERSON3], [PERSON6], [PERSON7, [PERSON8], [PERSON11]
Purpose of meeting: Discussing [PROJECT3], [PROJECT5], [PROJECT6]

-Added information
--[ORGANIZATION7] hasn't provided any data yet.
--[ORGANIZATION6] deadline has been moved to 7th of October.
--One of the colleagues has an overview of the important conference dates.
--[ORGANIZATION7]<unintelligible/> seems to be having a problem with finding volunteers.
--It's needed to count with the possibility of [ORGANIZATION7] not delivering any useful data.
--People who don't know any Czech or Estonian are needed, native English speaker would be perfect.

-Data set with multi-reference
--There are Czech reference translations to 50 source English sentences.
--There are about quarter milion reference translations per one sentence.
--Created semi-automatically.
--Dozen thousand references per one sentence is common.

-[PROJECT6] from Czech to English evaluations
--System outputs manually post-edited and a secondary annotator confirmed, if the translation is good.
--About 600 unique source sentences.
--Up to 16 reference translations.

-Possible weekly meetings, daily reports
--The daily reports should be more beneficial for socializing with the rest of the team.

-Experiment with [ORGANIZATION2]
--There was a meeting on Friday.
--The available budget is lower than expected.
--They will come up with a number of translators doing the post-editing.
--They will come up with the price.
--This will give an estimate on the total number of sentences.

-E-mail to make a proposal on how to divide the documents
--Some e-mails were already sent, but there were mostly no replies.
--The next step is to inform them, that the project is proceeding.
--The number of people is also needed in order to come up with the number of possible segments.
--Once the number of people is settled, it is possible to propose the set of documents.

-E-mail a formal complaint
--The person in charge of this issue is leaving the project.
--It is important to find out who is taking over to solve the problem.
--Ask the person to forward the e-mails and get the needed speakers.
--Thus they don't need to do the evaluation, only provide the users for the test.
--This way the task is easier to accomplish even with people leaving.

-[PROJECT5] right now
--The back translation is running now.
--It's slowed down a bit because of experiments on GPUs.
--If the tempo is the same, all the data should be translated in two or three days.

-Participation in system demonstration in [ORGANIZATION6]
--Doing a demo submission of [PROJECT3] and [PROJECT4] would be a good idea.
--The deadline is unknown.
--Could be a shorter version of the paper for [PROJECT1].
--The demonstration should focus more on the framework rather than experiment results.
