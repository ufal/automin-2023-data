i'm sort of really bad in english today.
but i guess we can wrap it up and see you next week.

asr worker and machine translation into czech will be run three times.
we have only one english segmenter, so we can run only two unintelligible> at once.
we don't rely on the german, on the english segmentation worker so that that could run as well..
i'm speaking german, now i'm speaking english and i should see german translation.
i think we might want to try [ORGANIZATION4], you, unintelligible>, the [ORGANIZATION4] as well.
(PERSON12) i'm following the german words that i spot.
occasionally they are related, but i cannot acess the sentence quality.
that's too hard for me to to process..
i don't know how to share it,how to do it.
so i'm sharing my screen, entire screen.
allow.
so i'm sharing my whole screen but the full motion icon has hidden away.
so i don't know how to, maybe it's not possible to do with the with the screen sharing..
in pexip screensharing, you see an update only every two seconds.
and to the hd button is the thing that will let you see it in live like faster, without this delay.
we had to click it before now it's broken apparently..
right now on the cable, a connection [PERSON11]'s notebook is sending three english, three audios? [PERSON11], are you sending three english, three audios? mumbling> only two.
but we need to send one audio for each output language..
all their workers are meant to work in a transparent behavior they translate multiple times.
this, of course, is not optimal and managing such logic in the presentation layer.
i'm trying to figure out something to manage it for the june eh fair-the june meeting..
the empty worker should be totally like ignoring any context.
if it's recieve something twice, it should send it twice.
if it is a minor extension of the sentence then the empty worker should not have been called..
i run a test with the english asr, maybe it was me, i wrack now finish sorry.
i prepared the unintelligible> which uses the german asr.
the german segmenter.
i can surely unintelligible> and going to write it in the google doc..
if this works in two weeks from now it would be perfect.
if we have the m3u8 url we can configure the presentation platform to connect to this streaming.
if we have the m3u8 url we can put it in the presentation platform..
czech web page is a simple client and it only display what it recieves.
i haven't worked on the source code so i'm not able to share it with you.
i can ask for- (PERSON12) yes, we need also letting 2 or utf8..
i can see [PERSON3] now.
and maybe [PERSON11] can now start to meeting participants in control unintelligible>.
i suggest the english one since it's it's much more reliable.
but, we could use for example.
i'm going to write it in the slack channel.
(PERSON12) yes, the out- input fingerprint is wrong, it's dd, unintelligible>..
i'm running my test.
and it's not working.
why? i think it's a matter of web browser i'm using.
i'm also on two different computers i don't understand if something also related to- it's seems that in my windows laptop it isn't displayed anything even if i run it in chrome, but on my linux desktop it works's well..
we haven't yet tested the multiple publication unintelligible>.
but we have still some problem with of course browsers and windows.
i'm curious if this will scale up to the six or more target languages and the multiple-input..
i'm a little bit worried that there will be no time for improving this because it will be like creating new models and improving the underlink set up.
i'm a little bit worried that there will be no time for improving this because it will be like creating new models and improving the underlink set up..
i'm afraid that we'll have to live with the current segmentation quality.
but please try, please get in touch with - (PERSON7) unintelligible> (PERSON12).
if you have any questions on [PERSON4], then he should appear here.
if you have any questions, then i would like to ask everybody who is still on the call, to go through the the current state of the google document..
we haven't yet tested the multiple output, but should be pretty transparent.
we haven't yet tested the multiple sources for the same language.
we haven't yet tested the multiple output, but should be pretty transparent..
default available languages will be czech, polish, hungarian, what else.
dash pub will be grabbed by the worker for the presentation platform.
if we add dash pub it will be grabbed by the worker for the presentation platform..
the map is needed for the overall connection, what is connected to what.
if someone runs a worker with some particular fingerprints there is no way for us to change it's fingerprints.
if there is a worker connected to the mediator, there is no way for us to change it's fingerprints..
fingerprints map, share, anyone with the link and edit.
i'm now putting link to this map to the google doc.
try opening this as well.
(PERSON3) no, it would be better if you could access directly the document.
so please the way this drawing works is that you while you are editing an object, no one else sees it yet..
cscz pub is a minus pub, but the german and italian are different.
cscz pub is a minus pub, so the english is, english has eun it's not like gb.
cscz pub is a minus pub, so the english is, english has eun it's not like gb.
cscz pub is a minus pub, so the english is, english has eun it'.
there is no way that any spanish can appear here until [PERSON11] will run a pipeline which will end with spanish pub.
for this pipeline to be accessible there has to be the worker registered already with it mediator that emits the spanish spain pub fingerprint.
(PERSON12) no, just google for their names.
or the names if they sound french, then we have to- (PERSON12) yeah, vlamish..
i'm running windows 10 and this is windows 7, but does not have a microphone with.
i'm not sure if i'm sharing the screen, i'll share my camera instead.
i'm not sure if i'm sharing my screen, i'll stop sharing my camera instead..
i think it's optimize in relation to the mobile usage, because mobile will probably require more space for for subtitles.
it would be better to have it optimized for being vertical, because then you have space for the subtitles.
for the desktops it would be better to to have the subt- the video larger..
css adapts to the size of the screen, but it can't be used on the desktop.
the problem is to let still the subtitles to be displayed.
i'm not allowed to share the whole worker logic because actually we have a really complex project.
but i can prepare some kind of snippet and i can share them for sure..
cnn's john sutter asks everyone on the call today at 1 to contribute to the fingerprint map.
sutter: "i think the most important thing for now is the map of the fingerprints" sutter: "we need everybody to check that their workers are like signing themselves with the right, with the right fingerprints".
the goal for monday was to test more languages in presentation platform.
i'm not anymore nervous that i was before, but actually i'm not anymore nervous.
i'm not sure if [PERSON4] is here if he can hear us or not..
