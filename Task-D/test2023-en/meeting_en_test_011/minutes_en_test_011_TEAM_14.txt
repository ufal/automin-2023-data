[PERSON3] read them it, and yes, this is very nice paper.
(PERSON3) [ORGANIZATION1], yes and - Okay but that [PERSON3] can use the [ORMANIZATION2] and [PION9) can use SL word read the context word and manning.
The participants of meeting could do the tactogrammar the [OTHER10], as [PERSON2] said.
[PERSON3] can hear (PERSON3).
And they check how much it makes a difference if there is some simply intervening and now (PERSON2) is fraze.
[OTHER10]s but kind stuff might also be because they use like it's a confusion score PS (PERSON2) too.
(PERSON2) can start with [PROJECT5] and [OTHER10] or [PERSON2] dunno.
(PERSON2) can try [OTHER9] [OTHER4] is [OTHER5] and there are the manner annotation, and these annotations are - The manner annotation is - [OTHER9] is a tactogrammatical treebank annotated on [OTHER11], [OTHER7] is an tactogrammological treebank, and [OTHER2] is an annotated treebank.
Sorry, (PERSON3) can't understand, [PERSON3 don't know] what news functors?
(PERSON2) mean on top of the on top the transformer, [PROJECT5] used a perceptor or -
[PERSON3] guys were talking about with the people in [LOCATION3]?
The participants of the meeting want to have a skype call that the participants of meeting need.
What (PERSON2) did was looking in to a transformer attention matrices because previously and computive for ee sentence from [PERSON3) r call. for use for black box.
[PERSON10] proposed one from different photo like one observation was that (for the), let's say easier find determiners or multifiers.
But then it was quite good but say like the subject finding su object there's few one like one head that was specialized eeh looking for that particulation, let's say.
And for those the determiners modifiers those heads look like justs looking up the neighborhood but context the words just shift that one of it's one to way to find determiners and something some clients is in that eeh variations that's look plus one, minus one just with any fix pattern.
(PERSON3) is training about its raise or the dependency trees or -?
(PERSON2)'s observations are that there are almost all possible balustrades somewhere or at least according to [PERSON2's] observations.
Eeh, but actually it was only heads balustrades difference than have mix from cognition and (balustrades).
It seems that the different heads do different stuff.
(PERSON2) should say one thing the participants meeting tried to have the similar results here in a use not nevermind then use open NMT system and try to generate somethink like balustrades and the participants of the meeting have many problems many problems with generating something similar like similar, balustrades.
The participants the meeting don't know that there are some like balustrades maybe they have different parametres a little bit.
(PERSON2) think common factor in paper some heads are a bit specialized in finding one high correlations.
[LOCATION2] is a meeting of (PERSON2), [PROJECT5], [PERSON3], [CHANNEL2], and [PONT3].
Actually (PERSON3) wanted to try to extract the graph structures compare how was like similar syntactic trees or different types trees participants of meeting can (extract) from syntax.
The idea was that the participants the meeting could try to replicate this and compare it with the extract from the attentions.
With the objective function to be as similar as possible to [PERSON5] if (PERSON3) (redisconnect) it.
And by this training they also, they also report better results improvement in they in they target these two heads like gold syntax.
[PERSON5], (PERSON3) will send (PION9) the links to tactogrammatic when (PASTER9) can when (SERSON9) can download the treebank and the other link (PRAFT9) need and other anything (PINTER9) need to start experimenting and downloading.
[PERSON5] has been added to (PERSON3), and [PASTER3] will be in contact with (PASTER9) in next 14 days.
