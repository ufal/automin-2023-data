-Welcome to theERSON7s!,<n>Hi, sorry for coming late. [PERSON7s, PERSON7s, PERSON7s, PERSON7s, and PERSON7s.
-[PERSON7] you are trying to recover from your past, missed sessions by coming twice, but yeah that's not the problem, you're muted.
-So there is just one explanation for the slowness of the recognition quality of the machines. So there is just one explanation for the slowness of the recognition quality of machines.
-Please get in touch with [PERSON9], and, try to debug the recording from yesterday, so you can see what we can do about the recognition quality.
-In the [PROJECT16 Test set, [PROJECT16] has added some files to the [PROJECT16 Test set, which is English, non native, and in [PROJECT16 Test set.
-Last night I had a call with [PERSON12], we had a call with [PERSON12], we had a call with [PERSON12], we had a call with [PERSON12], we had a call with [PERSON12], we had a call with [PERSON12], we had a call with [PERSON12], we have to address this problem.
-The problem is that there are files that are too big to be uploaded to [PROJECT3], which means they are too big to be uploaded to [PROJECT3.
-Now, I am looking so i can just upload it as a link file or something like that.<n>Now, I am looking so i can just upload it as a link file or something like that.
-Is there a possibility that [ORGANIZATION1] server may be up again (or not) now?,<n>I haven't heard back from [PERSON4 on whether [ORGANIZATION1] server is up again or not.
-Please be in touch with [PERSON4], for the extended set of target languages, and are you in touch with [PERSON14 for the text files for the dominetration.
-The domain specific data is useful in the long term, but it is better if people have experience with [PROJECT7] to collect the text data.
-The data that [ORGANIZATION10], has are just view, read only, so you can't download it, read only, or download it.
-There are also videos so that even transcript, you can't get it unless you apply for it.<n>Make an account to get to see the dataset.
-There is a clear distinction between thePROJECT Archive, which are the interviews with the survivors of World War II of Holocaust, and the historical papers and presentations by historicians.
-The problem with this is that there is no way to get the access to the file, even if you apply for one, the access is not available.
-He should also scan the web pages of the people, rather than in depth, so that he has whatever he can, even if he is still waiting for some resource.
-[PERSON6] and [PERSON2], will you be here after the call, will you be here after the call, will you be here after the call.
-This is just because I have a dentist's appointment, in one hour, and I want to assure you that we are calculating exactly the way we should do if you see the code.
-The alignment waits for it saves is for example 800, which is the marginal one.<n>The alignment waits for it saves is for example 800. This is the marginal one.
-Please have a look at the [PROJECT environment in the [PROJECT7] paper.<n>Okay, so please have a look at the [PROJECT environment in the [PROJECT7] paper.
-This is exactly the reason why I came to this phone call, but the reason why I came to this call is exactly the reason why I came to this call.
-If you have time in the afternoon for a call, that would probably be faster, but you would need to write the answers down, because you would probably have time in the afternoon for a call.
-The other paper is the [PROJECT demo paper, I think you wrote most of paper, so [PERSON15], I think you wrote most of paper.
-laugh> So, could you perhaps, try revising the paper and looking at the reviews that we got, to, like a help with that one?
-Look at the paper, it is six pages long, and there are reviews plain text file, so if you could look at this would be extremely useful.
-Let's move on to experiments, the idea that I have, is that we use again the [PROJECT quality is very bad for all remotely handled sessions, and especially if people are wearing face masks.
-You should work on the evaluations first and for you, this is a lower priority, because you should be like really focusing on getting the systems ready, getting the systems ready.
-Read the reviews of the paper, the demo, and any other work that you can briefly say briefly, such as your other work, if you can briefly say briefly.
-Continue with data preparation of Dev test corpus and redo alignments of source and targets of interpreters on the Dev test corpus, and repeat the analysis on more accurate alignments of source and targets.
-Update from [PERSON5], which is the latest update from [PERSON5, which is the most recent version of the [PERSON5 update.
-If you have some short term processing of [ORGANIZATION that is like where computation time is needed, then start it in time, because he will also be struggling.
-Use Czec to process files that have [PERSON7] audio codec, [PERSON7] audio codec, and [PERSON7 audio codec for English training data.
-To improve the performance of the English language, we need to like go into this with Czech data, for example, the 25th like 10 days of training.
-Start a paper on the pipeline preparation tool, or pipeline configuration tool, please summarize for everybody, since I've already asked you to summarize for everybody.
-Create a pipeline for a different event, like some machine translation, some online subtitles, and some docker, that are in the pipeline that are in docker.
-So the first thing that we would need to do is to test the pipeline in terms of availability and speed of running through the [PROJECT10 evaluation launcher.
-Next week there is going to be a conference about life subtitles and transcription, so we will need to get some feedback from the people that are using our subtitles.
-If you could adapt the tool to the participants.<n>Prepare the participants to follow the instructions that you and [PERSON could come up with.<n>Prepare the participants to follow the instructions that you and [PERSON could offer.
-Start on the twenty fifth of January, if you could share with, [PERSON15], if you could share with, [PERSON7] your simple feedback clicking page.
-Ask the people to tell us the quality of the outputs, the description of the outputs, the description of the outputs, the description of the outputs, the description of the outputs.
-Please, let's focus on the like separate stand alone one shot of things, because, you should focus on the like separate stand alone one shot of things.
-If you are a member of the [PROJECT test set, you will be asked to provide some [PROJECT data in the public domain, which is confidential.
-Yeah, this is for [PERSON, Yeah?, Yeah, this is for [PERSON, Yeah?, Yeah, this is for [PERSON, Yeah?
-Present the summary of the systems on the week of [PROJECT1], systems on the week of [PROJECT1], systems on the week of [PROJECT1, systems on the week of [PROJECT1], systems on the week of [PROJECT1, systems on the week of [PROJECT1], systems on the week of [PROJECT1, systems on the week of [PROJECT1], systems on the week of [PROJECT1, systems on the week of [PROJECT1], systems on the week of [PROJECT1, systems on the week of [PROJECT1], systems on the week of [PROJECT1, systems on the week of [PROJECT1], systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1], systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [PROJECT1 systems on the week of [
-This week's will be presented by the speaker of the last week's, as well as the presenter of the last week's.
-Have the transcripts sent to the seminar team, so that they can review the transcript, so that they can understand what is going on in the seminar, so that they can understand what is going on in the seminar.
-To make some [PERSON17]es in their editor and to the manual, or a revision of more conveniently, or a revision of more conveniently.
-So we need to look at the outputs of [PROJECT1], English to Czech, because the bleu score will be lower, but the output will be 80 percent of input length and the output will be the lower bleu score.
-The output campaign needs to be evaluated in new [PROJECT evaluation campaign, test set evaluations need to be manually validated or evaluated, bleus are bound to be lower.
-If anybody has anything else to say to all others, then what is your status PERSON>?,<n>PERSON you're here, and you did not say anything.
