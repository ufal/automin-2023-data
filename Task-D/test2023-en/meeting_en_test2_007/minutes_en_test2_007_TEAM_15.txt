-The data that [ORGANIZATION10], does not give direct access to the data.
-Please have a look at the [PROJECT environment] in German English and what is probably happening according to description in German paper and what should be happening.
-Start a paper on the pipeline preparation or pipeline configuration tool (PERSON7).
-The training pipeline on that private data stood loader within the [PROJECT9], framework is a black box and it is quite complicated.
-To answer your concern, we decided first to calculate C without alignment and with alignment. We just put the maximum between without Alignment and with Alignment. This is for your information.
-The German verb "gezacht" (ProJECT) is split into two parts, the content bearing part and the late part of the German verb.
-The problem with the [PROJECT1] system is that there are words in the sentence which are more or less monotonically aligned to standard English grammar.
-proportionally alignment values and the proportional values will be comparable.
-If we are doing the alignment based thing, then we should follow the alignment of the linear order progress of maximisation, that makes sense, but maxing it with proportional alignment doesn't make sense.
-Please have a look at the current description, it is like excessively detailed and not correct.
-The formula for t shirt is this two three, five zero.This should be the end times of the words of the two three three, four zero.
-This is based on the word 'PERSON2' in C, but it is not based on characters.The PERSON2 is based only on characters in C.
-Persian is not based on words, words are more important than time and place in the Persian language time is faster and slower than the other language time, because time is more important.
-This is probably the most difficult part of this problem, that is based on the C segment and the number of characters in the transcript or the C-section.
-The problem with this is that there is no formula for calculating this, and that is very complicated. laugh> This is mainly for when we do not have any alignment information.
