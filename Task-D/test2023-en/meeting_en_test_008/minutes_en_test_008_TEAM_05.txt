-[PERSON5] I think we need to evaluate your criterias in a different way so that we can have a sense of what good and bad minute looks like.
-: Maybe we all can annotate a single minute (PERSON8's criteria) or audience criteria we all - judgement we all - judgement we all -
-Draft minutes : We will draft minutes for all three of us to judge the judgment of the draft minutes, so we can easily finalize the draft minutes.
-: If we have annotators, we are also gonna have a judge, which is also gonna have ten annotators, which is also gonna have ten annotators.
-: So currently we are not going ahead with the alignment thing right? : Say once more, please, : Say once more, please.
