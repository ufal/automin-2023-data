doodle unintelligible> applies to regular weekly time..
if you see the gender this is the link to the from 9.
from 9.
october.
i will copy paste it to the today's gender.
so that you can also open it.
i didn't find it i don't know why..
the interface can be seen in a web application.
the blue one.
it does have web application front-end which.
(PERSON5): the blue one.
it does have query and summary based system..
a paper from 2020 september has a fact-based evaluation system.
it has a web interface for annotating transcripts and summaries.
ehm: i think you just come up with what you consider to be the best..
i think the annotators will be able to evaluate it in a better way if you just have web base interface for manually evaluation.
i'm still not sure how the manual evaluation work mutely.
do you want it for training data.
or you want it for both?.
"i'm absolutely okay with the interface.
but it is at the annotator's task" "we have very cris example that what is a good summary and what is a bad summary" "the drafting is very much boring.
the drafting from our link is very much boring".
i think for the first shared task i would like absolutely keep everything as simple as possible.
i did implement all of the existing to matrix.
but not something new.
i don't have any progress with the new thing..
i implemented the all the beginning of the paper, but i didn't do something new.
i did.
it took me really long to fix that.
i might link the papers which i did.
i'm doing it with our data and not the ami and the icsa corpora..
