(PERSON5): So [PERSON7] we have discussed with [PERSON8] your negotation. (PERSON7): Are there any links to that of the-
Ye, for the manual evaluation thing. (PERSON7): I just want to know a few things from you regarding that europarl website maybe you can guide me. I don't know if this website has gotten index of the minutes just like it had for the transcripts. And here here we are not on within the [ORGANIZATION3] website.

[PERSON5], do you have any example how my cautions do work on a minutes. (PERSON5): Yes, everybody-
(PERSON7): With the transcript, ye. So-
(PERSON7): So on our paper do you have any figures that how the matrix work. If we are able to align minutes and transcripts automatically what. (PERSON5): Yes, so to find for each meeting-
(PERSON7): Okay, because for-
(PERSON5): Each transcript finds its minutes this is the-
