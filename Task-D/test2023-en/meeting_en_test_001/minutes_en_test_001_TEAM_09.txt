(PERSON5) So, <laugh>, thank you <unintelligible> for joining, I actually <ehm> assumed that you will be away

(PERSON5) and that's - that's great that we have someone from [ORGANIZATION1] -

(PERSON5) <ehm>, and <ehm>, yeah we have <ehm> we have everyone probably because [PERSON4] is not responding

(PERSON5) I emailed him yesterday -   oh, <other_unrecognisable speech>, okay and -

(PERSON5) <Ehm>, [PERSON4] is responding, okay,   so [PERSON4] will join a little bit <ehm> later -

(PERSON5) and he won't have <ehm> headsets <other_yawn>

(PERSON5) So, <ehm>, <other_noise> the goal for today will be to <cough> get <ehm> everything (money) on this full workload,

(PERSON5) So [PERSON3] and and [PERSON20], who are here, <ehm>, I can show you, <ehm>, they're behind me -

(PERSON5) <ehm> We are - <laugh> <ehm> we are trying to get everything running - <ehm> on our side <ehm>, so that we have more (interchannels).(PERSON5) <ehm>, and <ehm>, I think that on your side everything hould be okay, so-

(PERSON5) <ehm>, maybe if <ehm>, sh should be <other_noise> yeah okay,

(PERSON5) so let's first go through the topics <ehm> in the- <ehm>, in the document

(PERSON9) (Hey) guys, good morning.(PERSON5) Yep, hi, morning, great-

(PERSON5) <ehm>, so, I suggest to first go through the topics in the <ehm> [PROJECT2] document  , <unintelligible> document,

and <ehm> then <ehm> do any (debugging) <ehm> which is necessary <ehm> to see - <ehm>  

to see what is working and what is not working.(PERSON5) <ehm> We can already get to <unintelligible> <cough> for - call the whole Wednesday,

(PERSON5) <ehm> and Tuesday afternoon is also very <ehm> likely.(PERSON5) So (I'l), stop my camera, share my screen, <ehm>,  <other_noise>

(PERSON5) Hello, yeah, <ehm> so this fingerprints map <ehm>

it's now <ehm> a bit more legible <ehm>, because it's <ehm> <unintelligible>   <other_unrecognisable speech>

(PERSON5) and - <ehm> [PERSON3] is <ehm> like <ehm> overseeing this and and checking if everything is missing.(PERSON5) <ehm> I haven't had the time to update the diagram, <ehm> the sketch, so in essence the - the <unintelligible>sheet is <unintelligible> -

(PERSON5) and this should be the grapf, but we don't have - <ehm> we don't have the graph.(PERSON5) <ehm> okay, so as I said, <ehm>, for today I would really like to see the full workload,

(PERSON5) so all of your imputs, <ehm>, and all target languages in the presentation platform -

(PERSON5) to see how that behaves.(PERSON5) We can think that this is one of the re-speakers, <ehm>, and <ehm>, we would like to switch the subtitles to present another source of that language.(PERSON5) So if <ehm> several imput <ehm> (Englishs), and we would like to switch <ehm> those.(PERSON5) <ehm> yeah, so, everything is going -

<ehm> so, <ehm> <unintelligible> [PERSON9] or [PERSON8] can you please explain?(PERSON9) Yes (sure), <ehm>

(PERSON5) Yeah.(PERSON9) The presentation platform available <unintelligible> is not yet (updated)

(PERSON9) <unintelligible> support and switching <other_noise>

(PERSON9) <unintelligible> (friends) <unintelligible> <ehm> 

(PERSON9) A working copy will be <ehm> (deployed) next week.(PERSON9) <unintelligible>   <ehm> <other_noise>

(PERSON5) Yeah.<other_unrecognisable speech> 

(PERSON9) <unintelligible> support <unintelligible> publishing <unintelligible> different languages, but they all (may be) published with using the <other_noise> English as <unintelligible> language.(PERSON9) Unfortunately, <ehm>, <unintelligible> is not <ehm>

(PERSON5) As - <oter_noise>

(PERSON5) I - <ehm>, I - , yeah I <unintelligible>, yeah

(PERSON5) The voice quality is again <ehm> not perfect.(PERSON5) <other_noise> So I thought that for this check <ehm> we want you to do the switching <ehm> by killing (off) the <unintelligible>-lines, and <ehm> using the <ehm> bridge <ehm> selecting different bridge <ehm> worker <ehm> starting (up) a different bridge worker and starting (up) the - <ehm> 

the <unintelligible>-line again.(PERSON5) Yeah, so this -

<ehm> this should - <other_noise>

we should be able to (test) this.(PERSON5) So, maybe - <ehm> <other_noise>

I'll just say <ehm>, so - <ehm>

yeah, we're testing the old option, the <ehm> bridge workers to select the <ehm> <unintelligible>

(PERSON5) Please <ehm> explain <ehm> whether the - <ehm>

the (planned) behaviour <other_noise> for the next week.(PERSON5) Yeah, so, so [PERSON9] actually since you are here, <ehm> you were not here when I was <ehm> saying that Wednesday is also available for the full (guesting) at <ehm> (South Premises).(PERSON5) Yeah, so, <ehm> so <ehm> as (said), <ehm> Wednesday is surely available from the very morning and <ehm> Tuesday <ehm> afternoon is also extremely likely.(PERSON5) So, if you come already at Tuesday lunchtime, we will make use of <ehm> all the <ehm> <cough> available <unintelligible> <ehm> very well.(PERSON5) So Tuesday lunchtime <ehm> would be already <ehm> sensible arrival, <ehm> if you can make it.(PERSON9) Okay, I can ask you about <unintelligible>

(PERSON5) Yeah, <unintelligible> <parallel_talk> <unintelligible> <\parallel_talk>

(PERSON9) Okay, okay, I will ask you.(PERSON5) <ehm> yeah and than - 
<ehm> so, (we'll do) the testing <ehm> in the second, once - <ehm> once [PERSON3] is - <ehm> is - 
(has) put everything together and on <ehm>, and so on.(PERSON5) What (ow)- <ehm> what occured to me <ehm> as a usable thing <other_noise> is <unintelligible> (the) various thing would be if all the interpreters int he four <ehm> (booths) would see <ehm> their <ehm> subtitles as the're being recognised.(PERSON5) So for example now if I saw me, if I saw my own English among the - <ehm> on the subtitles, which, for some reason, does not <ehm>, yeah -
oh okay, something is being updated and I don't see the actual words.(PERSON5) So, I cannot <ehm> (tune) my pronunciation to improve - <ehm> to improve what is <ehm> being reco- recognised or how do I - 
<ehm> how close am I to the microphone and and so on.(PERSON5) <ehm> for this, <ehm>, [ORGANIZATION5] can bring <ehm> sufficient laptops, we'll somehow get them,    I don't know, <ehm> wha have four but we will try.(PERSON5) I want you to doublecheck with [PERSON4], <ehm> whether <ehm> the - 
<ehm> whether they can still <ehm> connect (formal) laptops to the Internet.(PERSON5) Yeah, so the idea is to - to have <ehm> notebooks also in the interpreters' (booths), but we can run into physical limits, maybe there is not enough space on their desk and - and so on.(PERSON5) <ehm> and- 
but if we - if we succeed with the physical setup, <ehm> then - 
<ehm> my idea is that <ehm> in the <unintelligible> languages we would also have these <ehm> specific for <ehm> languages or <ehm> fake language labels,    which would correspond to the <ehm> ASR <ehm> of the individual <ehm> (booths) <ehm> - 
like <ehm> (ride away).(PERSON5) And <ehm>, I have not thought about the details, about the fingerprints,    I - I (let) this to - <ehm> to [PERSON3].(PERSON5) What is my little worry is thay we will actually need yet another <ehm> for couple of ASR, the corresponding language <ehm> ASR workers.(PERSON5) So this is <ehm> like an idea and I would like (that) [PERSON3] and - and <ehm> [PERSON9] or -
<unintelligible> to discuss how to do this <ehm>, so that the <ehm> network load is - is not duplicated again.(PERSON5) But, <ehm>, if - 
I thing it would -

(PERSON9) My - my only wor- worry is about <unintelligible>, <ehm> let's say <ehm>, service languages (like) <unintelligible> one <unintelligible> two and so on.(PERSON9) <ehm>, you will have - those service languages displayed also in the main page <parallel_talk> Yeah <\parallel_talk> of presentation platform.(PERSON9) And, so, also - 
(an) users will be <ehm> <parallel_talk> Yes <\parallel_talk> allowed to choose one of them <ehm>, and -
<other_yawn> I don't know if it's suitable or not.(PERSON9) In - in my opinion, <laugh> <parallel_talk> Yeah <\parallel_talk>

(PERSON5) I think it's okay, I like I would not worry.<parallel_talk> Okay <\parallel_talk>
(PERSON12) Ehm, maybe - maybe we can (lang-) we can label these <ehm> special languages only with <ehm> numbers.(PERSON5) <Ehm>, so, <ehm> maybe call it like (X1), (X2), (X3), (X4).(PERSON5) So - <ehm> so then, <ehm> no one would be likely to- to choose it and if they discover and they were like to follow these <ehm> direct (booth) channels then why not.(PERSON5) <ehm> Okay, so let's - let's move <ehm> forward <ehm>, so <ehm>- a very <ehm> relavant thing <ehm> is that we would - we should <ehm> try o collect some feedback from the participants.(PERSON5) <ehm> like if - if - if it - fails completely, there's no point in asking like- Were you happy with translation (quality) <unintelligible> polish <ehm> - so, we'll only ask <ehm> the questions that are relevant.(PERSON5) <ehm> my main <parallel_talk> Well, actually, <\parallel_talk> Yeah <parallel_talk> sorry I <unintelligible> <\parallel_talk> Yeah, yeah

(PERSON9) we have a lot of questions regarding the user interface, <ehm> <parallel_talk> Okay <\parallel_talk> 

(PERSON9) The fun- functionalities and -
you know (there're two) <ehm> maybe presentation(al) platform more  comfortable <parallel_talk> Great <\parallel_talk> for the user.(PERSON5) (Though) into form modified as - as - as you like <parallel_talk> (Okey) <\parallel_talk> and we'll organise a <unintelligible> [ORGANIZATION4] form anyone can edit <ehm> it   and, <ehm> we'll finalise the content of the form actually on Wednesday I suggest.(PERSON5) so if anyone would like to know anything about their part, <ehm>, feel free to add such questions in a way that is understandable to - <ehm> like a - late users.(PERSON5) Yeah, and <ehm> the last thing I wanted to mention is this <ehm> video, that we would like to record from - <ehm> from that, as you know the - the video form <ehm> the <unintelligible> was quite successful at least for u- for ourself, I think.(PERSON5) <ehm> and, I think that [PERSON4] (will not know) today,   I think that <ehm> ([ORGANIZATION3]) finally decide <ehm> only on Monday.(PERSON5) <ehm>, but <ehm>, anyway, I told the person <ehm> that <ehm> we would like, even if ([ORGANIZATION3]) does not (hello) him to - to go to the premises, that we would still like to do it well outside of the building, or <ehm> at [ORGANIZATION5], or wherever.(PERSON5) So, <other_yawn> this is - this is the [ORGANIZATION4] document <ehm> which <ehm> would be then the content of the video.(PERSON5) <ehm> and <ehm> these- the journalist never know what to tell you, wh- what they should ask, or <ehm> what- what (he) should tell them, so actually it's up to us to - <ehm> to propose the propose the content.(PERSON5) They - <ehm> they will then organise it in a nice way, but we need to <ehm> suggest what - what should appear in the video.(PERSON5) <ehm> so well <ehm > the- the person is avaiable and has the whole day <ehm> for us, <ehm> but <ehm> ([ORGANIZATION3]) needs to approve that he can enter the building, which is -
<ehm> which they probably allow without any problems,    and that he can record and what he can record.(PERSON5) <ehm>, I think (there) - is many sensible ways <ehm> how he can record something and still not record any of the participants, <ehm> and not our (inper)- iterpreters as well.(PERSON5) And we would still like to see these parts of the video, <ehm> but <ehm> in general, <ehm> someone needs to confirm, that - that he can be there with the equipment.(PERSON9) Okay, <ehm> please let us also know <ehm> if it's possible to record (the) something inside the - the building, because <ehm> maybe <ehm> we - we can (have) been providing recording by ourselves, at least some - <ehm> some (scene) of the situation and of the (booth) and <unintelligible> and so on.<parallel_talk> Yes, exactly <\parallel_talk> <unintelligible>

(PERSON5) Yeah yeah, so <parallel_talk> <ehm> <unintelligible> video <\parallel_talk> what - what I - what I <ehm> also have is a - is a -
like a regular camera, big one, that <ehm> I use <ehm> at the - <ehm> at the <unintelligible>, <ehm> so, <ehm> I also -
well- t- try to - <ehm> get some material as a background, possible background <ehm> images.(PERSON5) Is -
a - the - the room <parallel_talk> Yes, sure <\parallel_talk> is not in the street regime, the - the room <ehm>, the lecture room, is -
you don't need an ID card to enter this room, ehich is different from the normal premises of ([ORGANIZATION3]).(PERSON5) Okay, so <parallel_talk> Okay <\parallel_talk> 
(PERSON16) <unintelligible> is not working <unintelligible>, is it?(PERSON2) <ehm> I am checking my microphone, because - I don't see my name like <unintelligible> <ehm>, so I thought it was broken and now it's finally working <parallel_talk> We can hear you, we can hear you <\parallel_talk>, okay.So, the thing is, <ehm> even with the interpreters, <ehm> there was this requirement <ehm> for the confidentiality or (no dis)closure, so I don't think it will be this easy to - get permission to record anything.(PERSON5) Yeah, <ehm> so the idea is to record <ehm> like the setting and what we do there, so the (wires) and an empty room, or <ehm> interpreter's (booth) or maybe to watch our participants,

the - like the biggest thing would be to watch our participants from behind <laugh>.(PERSON5) So we can make <ehm>, maybe <ehm>, like <ehm> <other_unrecognisable speech>
(PERSON16) Yeah, and you will (probably meet)- also someone (disclosure) (for)- from the journalists, because <unintelligible> he will be there, he will hear stuff.(PERSON5) So this is - this is for [PERSON1]

(PERSON5) Can you email [PERSON1], that <ehm> we need to have -
because <ehm> what the journalist- <ehm> we cannot simply say <ehm> that he followed <ehm> the <ehm> like code of conduct of interpreters.(PERSON5) So it's us who confirm(s) (to) you, the ([ORGANIZATION3]), that <ehm> they have signed this non<unintelligible> agreement and they will not do any - <ehm> any bad thing.(PERSON5) So that's - that's not problem <parallel_talk> (I hope so) <\parallel_talk> yeah.(PERSON5) But <ehm> please <ehm> since the time is <ehm> getting short please -
<ehm> like -
<ehm> swiftly communicate any - <ehm> any concerns, <ehm> so that we can - <ehm> we can have him there and - and record it.(PERSON5) So in the worse case <parallel_talk> (Yeah, <unintelligible> regarding concerns, yeah)<\parallel_talk> yeah

(PERSON2) There were even concerns from the participants that- <ehm> the - thing the - things there will be talk - they will be talking about - will - be - <ehm> well, will (leak) too soon.(PERSON5) So <parallel_talk> <cough> <\parallel_talk> (there) are definitely concerns, with the <unintelligible>.(PERSON5) Okay, <ehm> s-
yeah, so well - I thing it's - <ehm> it's something that we all <ehm> can sign that we are not going to leak anything and that will be very <ehm> careful about the data and - all that, but  - obviously, (yeah) you- you have to decide.(PERSON5) <other_noise> So - so - <ehm> I don't know, maybe - maybe some of the sessions should be like <ehm> close
(PERSON9) for us or -
I don't know what - what the setup would be.(PERSON5) So - <ehm> so [PERSON4], your - your microphone is now <ehm> (very well) <ehm> -
we - we hear your typing (frantically), I guess (it's not) - <parallel_talk> Not me, not me.(PERSON5) So someone else <laugh> <ehm> anyway, <other_unrecognisable speech> let's <ehm>-

(PERSON9) <unintelligible> 

(PERSON5) Is it [PERSON11]?<parallel_talk> <unintelligible> <\parallel_talk>

(PERSON5) No - no, I don't know, we hear someone typing <em> (very) loud.(PERSON3) <unintelligible> (it was microphone but - I - I touched)

(PERSON5) (That)'s reasonable, I would say -

(PERSON3) I - I will check what- what does it listen to <parallel_talk> Yeah.<\parallel_talk>

(PERSON5) Yeah, so maybe we have the problem with the input quality, which can happen <ehm> all the time -

(PERSON3) No it's good.(PERSON5) Yeah, so that's -
<ehm> my voice correctly arise, so (not) French, Hungary, Italian, <ehm> Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Spanish -

(PERSON5) So I have the - full set of subtitles <other_noise>, but I don't have -
 <ehm> I see only some messy German <ehm> and some <parallel_talk> Yes <\parallel_talk> completely broken <ehm> English, so <parallel_talk> We still have only two English segmenters so we can run at most two languages at once.<other_noise> <cough> 

(PERSON5) Yeah, so for now I suggest that <ehm> we all keep <ehm> connected to this call and <ehm> we'll do the (debugging) an- at various places and <other_noise> if you are not (debugging) at - anything at any point, then -
<ehm> well -
just keep working on whatever you have to do -

<ehm> otherwise, but please keep listening in, <ehm> so that when you have problem <ehm> we can ask immediately.(PERSON5) <ehm> and - <ehm> I'll have to leave for another call in thirty minutes from now, but [PERSON3] and [PERSON20] will be <ehm> here <ehm> and-

another thing that we <ehm> still have not started (debugging) is the - <ehm> is the video - broadcastings, so we should make yoursel(f this) opportunity and see -
<ehm> yeah - if I can - <ehm>

if I can shift the video from Linux (mischief) for example.(PERSON5) So <unintelligible> <parallel_talk> <unintelligible> <\parallel_talk>

(PERSON5) Say it again?<parallel_talk> <unintelligible> German is being- is going to be published?<\parallel_talk> <other_noise>

(PERSON3) Yes, I - I - I - I turned (English) off and I started German,

cause I struggled with - (plunging) English and German at once.(PERSON6) Yes, <ehm> it's [PROJECT2].<unintelligible>.com

(PERSON11) <ehm>, it's not <unintelligible> (translation) service (then).(PERSON3) Yes, because we have English to German translator from <unintelligible> so, I - I think -

<parallel_talk> <ehm> o- okay, that's - <\parallel_talk> you (mustn't) <unintelligible> one.(PERSON3) But let's - let's try Romanian,   because there is only - (your) Romanian.<ehm> <other_noise> 

(PERSON3) Yes, we have.<ehm>

(PERSON11) (Okay, I can) - <parallel_talk>
What I noticed in the English channel is that <ehm> I still see a lot of <ehm> old English subtitles, some words about microprhone and recognising and reasonable - <\parallel_talk>

(PERSON5) And I think this is -
these words <ehm> were uttered by me several minutes ago.<other_noise>

(PERSON9) A- are you working on - on this problem or - or actually with (this) integration the -
(keep) the ASR or -   <other_noise>

(PERSON11) (Beside) - <ehm> yeah, we (don't) just (aware) <unintelligible> we're talking about this the other day (and we've forgotten), m-
partially the same thing <unintelligible> actually ASR.(PERSON11) <ehm> <parallel_talk> (zigzag) <\parallel_talk>

(PERSON11) [PERSON13] had some kind of <ehm> simple caching.(PERSON11) <other_noise> Yeah

(PERSON9) The <unintelligible> paper (sieze), <ehm> if I correctly unde(stand) the <unintelligible> <ehm> they maintain the <ehm> start time the same <ehm> until <ehm> <other_noise> the <unintelligible> is <ehm> finalised,

and then they <unintelligible> a new start time, when <ehm> it goes on in the press (diction).(PERSON11) Yeah, so, <other_noise> ([PERSON13]) - ([PERSON13]) - ([PERSON13]) just said these <unintelligible> loging to check this- <ehm>

(PERSON11) Am-
I - I think the idea is he logs it to - to determine that it really is the algorithm specified to the paper.<\parallel_talk> <ehm> let's- let's copy<unintelligible> this link to - the [ORGANIZATION4] document, because <ehm> in <unintelligible> it appears in many -
<ehm> in various channels and it's if you - if you <unintelligible> it.<other_noise>

(PERSON11) <ehm> 

(PERSON5) But if you are looking at the subtitles at [PROJECT2].<unintelligible>.com, <ehm> then <ehm> the English should be (live) what- <ehm> from what I - <ehm> what I'm saying.(PERSON5) So, <ehm> there should be <ehm> little or no <ehm> delay between my words and what and what appears in the English - <ehm> and -
<ehm> as for now - I - d - like at this point I see the English stuck and no <ehm> words of mine.(PERSON5) Where is my speech- <ehm> where (it) stuck word doesn't get through and why there is nothing in the - <ehm> in the Romanian.(PERSON21) <unintelligible> <ehm> the - the very last published message I can se on -
<unintelligible> form the publisher is <ehm> three minutes old now, so no one is publishing right now.(PERSON5) Yeah that's -
[PERSON3] says that that's (correct), so, [PERSON3], please, let us now, when <ehm> the publishing will start again and we will re<unintelligible> - re<unintelligible> things.<ehm> <other_noise>

(PERSON5) <unintelligible> who available o (the ASR) workers, ane <parallel_talk> For some reason (anyone here won't be) - <ehm> in the call.<other_noise> <parallel_talk> Takže máme tam dva- <\parallel_talk> <other_unrecognisable speech>

(PERSON9) Hey guys, sorry, may I make a stupid question?<other_unrecognisable speech>

(PERSON5) [PERSON3] emailed them <ehm> yesterday <ehm> and they did not respond to that email at all <unintelligible> <cough> five minutes ago and <unintelligible> didn's respond either.(PERSON5) <ehm> [PERSON3], is the ASR working at the moment?(PERSON3) (we're there)

(PERSON5) <ehm>, people cannot hear you, [PERSON3], for some reason <unintelligible> <parallel_talk> And now you can hear me, (right)?(PERSON3) Now we - I can -
or I can't share the screen, I  - <other_yawn> we have there two- two ASR workers from English, which are available.(PERSON3) Yes, <unintelligible>

(PERSON5) How many ASR workers are available and - <parallel_talk> Two are registered as available, but one of them is not working, so I try this scond one.(PERSON5) One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four-

so what I'm going to do now is to try <ehm> (login) to skype and- and reach <ehm> the <unintelligible> people <ehm> on Skype.<parallel_talk> <unintelligible> <\parallel_talk> <other_noise>

(PERSON3) <unintelligible>

(PERSON5) Yeah, one, two, three, four -

it didn't connect, okay, I <ehm> sent a message <ehm> to [PERSON14] on Skype hoping that <ehm> we'll connect - 
we'll somehow get respond from <unintelligible>.<parallel_talk> <unintelligible> <\parallel_talk>

(PERSON5) <unintelligible> (do that) - <other_yawn> 

stop sharing.<other_noise>

(PERSON3) So, here you can see that we are <unintelligible>

(PERSON9) Sorry guys, <ehm> anothers question - <laugh> 

<ehm> did we use the <unintelligible> send the audio in the (march fair)?(PERSON9) <ehm> [PERSON17] told me -
actually <ehm> <other_voice> out of office.(PERSON9) I'm trying to - call <unintelligible> in the office, <ehm> (we've) <unintelligible> 

I think at least we have both number [PERSON22] and the number of [PERSON7], but <ehm> at the moment none of them is <ehm> answering.<other_noise> <other_unrecognisable speech>

(PERSON9) <unintelligible>   <other_noise>

(PERSON3) So - so now we should be able to see - some German subtitles from - from many interpreters (from) one - 

mom- a mock-interpreter conference.(PERSON5) <ehm> I don't see them, I see only the old - <ehm> <unintelligible> <parallel_talk> Yes <\parallel_talk> okay, <ehm> <parallel_talk> Yes, it's running.<\parallel_talk>   <other_noise>

(PERSON5) So, then, can we <ehm> go form German to English and <unintelligible> English to other languages to (pass) the translation system from <unintelligible> [ORGANIZATION1].<other_noise>

(PERSON11) <unintelligible> <other_noise>

(PERSON3) Oh, let's try this.(PERSON3) Let's go - for - <other_yawn>   <other_noise>

(PERSON3) (Guys) this not working.(PERSON5) So, should I be <ehm> <unintelligible> all day - <parallel_talk> No, i- it's from audio.<\parallel_talk>

(PERSON3) Yes, so we have German to Polish <unintelligible> English.(PERSON3) I didn't start the publisher -

(PERSON9) [PERSON22] <unintelligible> and he told me that he's going to run the workers right now.(PERSON5) (PLPL)   <other_noise>

(PERSON3) Yes.(PERSON5) Jeden, jeden, jeden, okay <laugh>

(PERSON3) Jedno I.(PERSON5) By any chance, <unintelligible> other recording and all the old recordings, for example from [PERSON4] <ehm>

(PERSON21) I - I have <unintelligible> this desktop.(PERSON21) I can <unintelligible> to (my) -

(PERSON9) Hey guys, (what) -
so [PERSON22] <unintelligible>   <other_noise>

(PERSON5)  Yep, so <ehm>, I'm right now trying to find space to - <unintelligible> (the worker), (and) please <unintelligible> me.(PERSON10) <unintelligible> worker -

might be a little more difficult <ehm> because [PERSON7] is not here today for medical reasons.(PERSON5) So - so which <ehm> I - I don't know what like - <ehm> what happened to [PERSON7], I hope, that he - <ehm> that he'll get better soon.(PERSON5) But <ehm> last time hae also didn't know about the - the (private) call and the<unintelligible> (regularer), so, can you please make sure <ehm> that <ehm> like - <ehm> you're on the same page.(PERSON5) And n-
when I see you - <parallel_talk> <unintelligible> <\parallel_talk> and-

(PERSON10) I didn't recieve <ehm> (doodle) any more <unintelligible> so - I -

(PERSON5) Yes <ehm> <unintelligible> because it's the regular thing that every - <ehm> every week we (set) -
<ehm> like - <ehm> (it) - it is already month ago when we planned it for every friday.(PERSON5) And- and also yesterday <ehm> [PERSON3] was conducting <ehm> [PERSON7] and I'm- and and- and maybe also you about the <unintelligible> workers.(PERSON5) Yeah, but if you have also recieved the - <ehm> the email probably, so (what's) -

(PERSON5) Let's make sure that we are <ehm> <unintelligible> .<other_noise>

(PERSON19) No, ale sou hrozně -   <other_noise> <other_unrecognisable speech> <other_noise>

(PERSON5) So, <ehm> this is just to let you know <ehm>, you can still hear me -
<ehm> that I'm now also joining the other call.(PERSON5) So, <ehm> I'll try <ehm>to mute myself <unintelligible> <ehm> to keep hearing myself when I'll be talking <ehm> to the other call, but that -
(what) (we) (rarely) happening is ELG.(PERSON5) So [PERSON11], <ehm> the first <unintelligible> agenda is (metaphorum) and <ehm> I said that <ehm> there in the list it appears [PROJECT2] most likely -
<ehm> [ORGANIZATION1] and your name was a question mark.<ehm>

(PERSON5) Yeah, exactly, so at this point <parallel_talk> Yeah.(PERSON5) On- <parallel_talk> <unintelligible> <\parallel_talk>

(PERSON11) Oh, I'm the (LG-code) now, <parallel_talk> Yeah.(PERSON11) <laugh>

(PERSON5) Okay, so -   <other_noise> <other_unrecognisable speech> <other_noise> <other_unrecognisable speech> <other_noise>

(PERSON9) Sorry guys, what we are going to test right now?(PERSON9) Well, On- [PERSON5] <unintelligible> does, <ehm> but [PERSON3], are you still there?(PERSON2) Well, <ehm> this is probably not the perfectc- time <ehm>, but <ehm> I'd like to (raise) the point of (incriprion), that it would be nice to have -
<ehm> on the - on the presentation interface <ehm> to have the HTTPS mandatory at least.(PERSON2) Because if it's -

(PERSON9) At the moment, <ehm> we haven't had any requirements for <ehm> user (authentication), but <ehm> we (willing) to (use) it <ehm> in the next versions, not for this event, sorry.(PERSON20) Hi, this is [PERSON20], [PERSON3] is having some trouble with the connecting the Internet- 

we - we will join soon - like -

(PERSON9) Okay, <ehm>, actually there is <ehm>  problem in managing <ehm> user's data.(PERSON9) Ehm, for the GDPR <ehm> <unintelligible>, and - (the) requires <ehm> much more <ehm> deep reasoning (about) - on how to (store) user data.(PERSON9) And we require <ehm> much more <ehm> deep reasoning about it and this is the reason why in this version of this presentation platform we didn't store any <unintelligible> data.(PERSON9) Neither <ehm> username and password (that they) -

(PERSON2) Oh, we donť need a <unintelligible> participant username and password, one password for the whole call will be sufficient.(PERSON9) <laugh> Okay, <laugh>, <ehm> I cannnot (promise) it but <ehm> we will (work) - we will start work on it <ehm> as soon as possible.(PERSON19) <unintelligible> I work out  and have a look at <unintelligible>  <other_noise>

(PERSON2) Yes, I can't get any output from segmenter but I <unintelligible> get it from ASR.(PERSON9) And they <ehm> (pulled) me that actually it's - <ehm> it's easy to do things we already (reason) about it and <other_noise> it's available for the <unintelligible> <laugh>, okay?<other_noise>

(PERSON2) Yeah, <other_noise> <unintelligible> seems that - that one segmenter is running but the second one is not running.(PERSON2) I - I (launched) two instances of ebclient, two identical ones, one was from (NEU-lecture) <unintelligible> hybrid, into NEU text, and it doesn't output anything, and the second one was the same and it -

(PERSON19) Yeah.(PERSON2) Yeah, and, the second instance can't connect at all at this moment, but - yeah -
oh - wait - wait -

now it's connected and it's outputting -

the text,

(PERSON2) which seems that there's the - the same <unintelligible> ASR (but) sometimes it doesn't output anything.(PERSON19) So I am -
I right now have ten instances of this running all (off) (putting) hard files I - I don't even know which one you're connected to.(PERSON19) So, the problem might be - that - maybe the audio is not <unintelligible> sent correctly.(PERSON2) Because when I try un<unintelligible> text instead of text, send it to - ASR - now

(PERSON11) Sorry, <ehm> I think I'm gonna drop off this call, <ehm> I can see that there - 

(will we get) text through (hits) the empty workers, our empty workers, but obciously we haven't <unintelligible> to stress them yet.<\parallel_talk> the <unintelligible> the (possibility) <ehm> the -
in the <ehm> previous afternoon and probably it's not possible, I'm sorry.(PERSON2) I - I'm - I'm going to - 

my - microtest script  wit- with a test case and - and upload it to the (crise) control (repo).(PERSON9) Okay, <ehm> have you talk(ed) - <ehm> 

we - 

about <ehm> the <ehm> the (bridge) <unintelligible> fingerprints, we <unintelligible>

(PERSON2) Yes.(PERSON9) Okay, <ehm> <parallel_talk> W- would you exchange some emails - <\parallel_talk>

(PERSON9) Okay.(PERSON2) Just to restart cients, change the fingerprints -

(PERSON9) Okay, we can do it in the afternoon -

(PERSON2) What do you mean?(PERSON9) <ehm> if we - if you are available we can do it <ehm> now, but if you prefer to <unintelligible> (descripting) the - <unintelligible> control record we can do it also later - <parallel_talk> Yes.(PERSON2) Yes, so I'm - I'm - I will write <unintelligible> script as - as for the testing the ASR that it- it starts so many instances of - of the ebclient to send audio to ASR(+) segmenter - <parallel_talk> Yes.
