So let's wait until [PERSON15] and [PERSON6] get back from the break. (PERSON13) <unintelligible>
(PERSON10) Connect, actually connect. Yeah, so there is the chat window is being filled with failures of the ASR clients. I would like to hear from everyone what they are working on and and what's the status. And for the presentation platform by [PERSON15] and colleagues. And I 'm asking because as a fallback, we could use like terminal window. And also, there is a chance of having the real video mixers that you know about. And there will be probably real video mixer available for the three days or two days of the workshop. I think that having a text client would be useful also for debugging. (PERSON10) So that's in general this is good news that you're proceeding well. It's also possible then some cases it's not confirming to the interface, so like sending the done message to early, which is why you are only getting the first message. Then it will assume that is the first half of a partial sentence, and it will, it will output the sentence with dot dot dot at the end. And it will pend the next sentence because it thinks that them those two together make a full sentence. I think you should send it to [PERSON5], because he's the one working with ASR. Or is there-Should we use the text only client?For the testing? I do not know if [PERSON5] is still there, because-Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it has, you mentioned some problem of things being stuck somewhere. Right, is that-
(PERSON13) Sorry, that's <unintelligible>I think [PERSON14] mentioned ehm, mentioned the getting stuck ehm. (PERSON10) Then, [PERSON6], what we need is to have lines of text that resemble the output of the ASR. ASR output that will be getting as messages when it goes through the mediator. I see that as big risk, because it would be a different segmentation pipeline. You know, if we had a sample of online and offline, ten sentences, or I don't know, some small sample, just to compare. Because, I would like to know whether this is the problem with the client, I would check it. And the production client um so [PERSON14], can you say what this is. Oh, this is, oh yeah, ok, this is just the batch mode, so actually we do this differently. So please just write it down that we, we have solved this differently by going to simply offline mode and will focus on the batch operation later on. Yes, so I think that's still this line that I've just highlighted in the [ORGANIZATION4] document, where [PERSON14] says," I also need either the [PROJECT1] worker or text client for CTM to TXT, or better both, to get the final hypothesis. (PERSON3) Of course next week we can perform again test all together in order to check both segmentation worker and other things together. At some point, they will both be redone, but I can't promise that will be next week. (PERSON10) But what we are expecting all are MT clients in- and the workers, including the [PROJECT1] one, expect already the text, so the segmented output, right? They don't work, they don't work with CTM, but only only in sequence with first ASR and then segmentation. But but the ASR workers are not reliable <unintelligible> to to debug it or <unintelligible>
(PERSON10) To debug. So I understand that in order to test the machine translation, you always have to ship audio and you always have to rely on some ASR worker being available and that's problematic. And there is no immediate plan to to have such client, that would be able to digest CTM, send it and then use the segmentation worker in isolation, right?Is that correct? (PERSON10) Yeah, and hopefully [ORGANIZATION5] will find solution. I'd like to have sort of a more directed bugging session for that. So, this is, [PERSON6] said that he would like like more hands on debugging session so that you would do this join it. (PERSON14) By the way, I'm looking at the ASR output in chat. [ Um, it would be nice to have this directly translated at this level of individual worse, almost. It only handles the text as it comes out of the segmentor-
(PERSON10) After-
(PERSON14) - will using our segmentor, than there shouldn't be any any text. I'm lot confused about <unintelligible> 
(PERSON10) So you have mentioned a number of things that you do like number of tricks that you do within your segmentation worker, like detecting the end of sentence, adding 3 dots and things like that. So SLT [ORGANIZATION5] is connected to the mediator, doing some preprocessing for MT, for example, like PPE, and that sort of thing. <other_noise> Which is why I want to <unintelligible> also now frame work. (PERSON14) <unintelligible> reverse engineering, we actually have to look back into it. And we need to to decide online, which of these streams in concatenation with the ASR and the MT is the best set up. And everybody is, someone is some Czech person is speaking in English, and his English is horrible. So there is this 2 re-speakers in their <unintelligible>, so is pronounciation, simply works better with the ASR. (PERSON3) This should be done, this should be decided in the selection of pipes in the mediator and should be done by the client at the moment. The the the actual solution is to have a kind of combinatory explosion of all the possible match matching path. But the presentation platform would stay would stay alway on. And it would constantly keep checking for the various sources, right? This monitoring activity will be possible also at presentation level. So that means that I need the ASR worker again, and it needs to connect to the MT worker again. (PERSON3) But actually, killing the client is useful only to ehm in computational power on servers which was the workers. The presentation platform will recieve of course more streams. (PERSON14) I think what [PERSON15] is proposing is that all audio inputs are translated into all target languages at all times. And the one that I currently select will be presented to everyone. And the normal user is selecting which language he wants to see and this super user, the monitor of the presentation platform is choosing for all the followers of of Spanish, which Spanish source should they get, right? Well since we have the multitude of sources it is possible that will do it more often than than what is normal. Then dynamic choice even without ehm, even without killing all the clients. But let's put it as, let's put it there is an important point.
