i finally managed to train fasttext embeddings.
and as you can see the bands are actually there.
the fasttext image here seems much more, um, similar to the original glove that i trained..
[PERSON21] you can see the bands here and the bands here in the fasttext s image are similar.
[PERSON19] it's possible for czech, not for english.
[PERSON21] yes.
but fasttext shows the structure right away.
[PERSON21] yes.
but it's possible for czech, not for english.
[PERSON21] yes.
but it's possible for czech, not for english..
i've written something about debiassing i wrote a conclusion.
tonight the chocolates will be in the box and i rewrite the chocolates.
i'll either move it to your chapture or delete it..
[PERSON9] and figures at least in pdf and not it pgf, it's no problem.
[PERSON9] if we don't change the content of the figures just how they look.
[PERSON9] if only (the font) change and the picture will be same only the nicer and then i m sure it's ok..
[PERSON17] just, just avoid an other unintelligible> font.
[PERSON21] you will have figures in the missing sections like pca and ica.
[PERSON17] you can replot it so it has the same font as a book.
[PERSON21] sorry, what? [PERSON17] you can replot it so it has the same font as a book..
[PERSON9] so do you think you can make it to today or? more or less? [PERSON9] i think so.
[PERSON9] ok, i can do that.
after the text is written.
and finished.
[PERSON9] so that you know that you really have it, the chocolate is (reorder) in the box.
[PERSON9] yeah, but then you need to reorder the chocolate.
[PERSON9] yeah, but then you need to reorder the chocolate.

i think it s better if we have like, like one unintelligible> reviewer from, from [LOCATION2], when we have the book alm-, almost finished, we can, we can ask someone.
[PERSON17] yeah.
[PERSON9] it would be at least abstract or i don t know if i ask only, ok, we will have a book with unintelligible> about - [PERSON8] hm.
book, books often have summaries.
and they have the summaries in multiple languages so.
[PERSON9] boo-, book, book summary is, is more like, um, lon-, longer abstract usually.
[PERSON9] but the introduction would also be something like, what is the - [PERSON17] hm.
[PERSON8] yeah, there are no rules, in the books series that we should have a summary and, and summary in czech and something like that..
[PERSON9] i think longest book in the series would be the (light) lexikons.
[PERSON17] or [PERSON14] might be a good candidate.
[PERSON4] 119.
[PERSON9] but this is unintelligible> lexikon.
[PERSON9] yeah, [PERSON26] 110.
